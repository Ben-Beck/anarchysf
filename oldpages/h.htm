<h3>John Hackett: <i>The Third World War: August 1985: A Future History</i> (1978)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">This well-known future-war story, by a team of top-rank 
militarists, involves a limited nuclear engagement in which Birmingham and Minsk 
are destroyed; the war concludes with Communism wiped off the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">A.B., reviewing this novel in the <i>Cienfuegos Press 
Anarchist Review</i>, found it &quot;one of the crudest, crassest, and most boring 
bits of propaganda that have ever been written.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Joe Haldeman: <i>The Forever War </i>(1974)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">The war is not quite forever, but lasts over a thousand 
years, and is entirely witnessed, thanks to relativistic effects, by one 
trooper; the war (against the Taurans) is unsurprisingly shown to have been 
entirely pointless.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Forever War</i> was compared by P.S., 
in the <i>Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review</i> in 1978, with Harrison&#39;s <i>
Bill, the Galactic Hero, </i>both books being condemned—unfairly, although 
Haldeman&#39;s experience as a Vietnam combat veteran means that his descriptions of 
warfare sometimes obscure his anti-militarist message. Reviewed and recommended 
by

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sandy Hall: <i>The Godmothers</i> (1982)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Godmothers</i> has two interwoven plots. In one, a 
contemporary feminist circle takes on Toronto capitalism; in the other, a future 
where women run the world communication network is threatened by reactionary 
forces. The two are uneasily linked telepathically with past witchcraft and a 
zone outside of space-time. Though strongly feminist, it&#39;s not even libertarian.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">It was reviewed by Annamarie Allan in <i>
Peace News</i> in 1982, who felt that &quot;. . . the intensity of her desire to 
persuade has prevented a full realization&quot; of the novel&#39;s potential. In the way 
she characterizes women, but caricatures men, &quot;Ms Hall unfortunately lays 
herself open to the charge of demonstrating the same intolerance which she 
criticises so fiercely.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Edmund Hamilton: 'The Island of Unreason' (1933)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">&quot;Those who commit &#39;breach of reason&#39;—as, for example, by refusing the mate assigned to them by the Eugenic Board—are sentenced to spend time on the Island of Unreason, where there is 
&quot;no form of government&quot;.&quot; (Dan Clore)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In practice, the island is dominated by the most successful male 
fighter, the inhabitants living in a Hobbesian state of nature rather than an 
anarchy in any positive sense.<br>

<h3><img border="0" src="covers/thehandmaidstale.jpg" width="32" height="44"> <i>
The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</i> (1990, dir. Volker Schlöndorff)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Margaret Atwood&#39;s dystopia, adapted for the screen. In a 
patriarchal theocracy, the tiny minority of fertile women are in effect enslaved 
as breeders. After a failed escape, the story follows one woman up to the point 
of her next escape, the degree of success of which is left uncertain.</p>

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Charles L. Harness: <i>The Paradox Men</i> (1953); &#39;The Rose&#39; (1953)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">For Moorcock, &quot;<i>The Paradox Men</i> with its sense of 
the nature of Time, its thief hero, its ironic references to America Imperial, is 
highly entertaining.&quot; He also singled out &#39;The Rose&#39; as a particular 
favourite. (Moorcock 1978)</p>
<h3>
James Harrington: <i>The Commonwealth of Oceana</i> (1656)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">
Sometimes described as a utopia, but Marie-Louise <a href="biblio.htm#Berneri">
Berneri</a> correctly described it as belonging to the category of ideal 
constitutions rather than ideal commonwealths. She noted—as did Max
<a href="biblio.htm#Nettlau: Esbozo">Nettlau</a>—its significant influence on 
the constitutions of the United States and particularly of Pennsylvania.</p>

<h3>
<img border="0" src="covers/harrisonbergeron1995.jpg" width="32" height="44"> <i>
Harrison Bergeron</i> (1995, dir. Bruce Pittman)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Made for TV, and based on the Vonnegut short story, but 
considerably reworked. Good, but the 2009 version (entitled <i>
<a href="0.htm#2081">2081</a></i>), which reverted to the original, is 
appreciably better.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><a href="biblio.htm#Osborne">Osborne</a> reviewed the film 
enthusiastically (but before <i><a href="0.htm#2081">2081</a> </i>came out): 
&quot;For a cinematic attack on enforced equality, you could hardly do better than 
this wonderful film. [. . .] This is a moving and stimulating experience, and 
one of the most dead-on libertarian films ever made.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Harry Harrison:<i> &#39;</i>The Streets of Ashkelon&#39; (1962; aka &#39;An Alien 
Agony&#39;); <i>Bill, the Galactic Hero </i>(1965); <i>The Stainless 
Steel Rat Gets Drafted </i>(1987)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">For John Pilgrim the 1962 story (&quot;this horrific little 
tale&quot;) &quot;poses the question of the amount of harm that the introduction of 
religion would do to a race who had 
managed to develop without any concept of the supernatural, or of God. The 
author&#39;s standpoint here is that the harm would be enormous and irreparable&quot; . . 
. (Pilgrim 1963)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Moorcock found <i>Bill, the Galactic Hero</i> 
&quot;very funny&quot;, as a send-up of Heinlein. P.S. didn&#39;t get the joke: &quot;The drawback 
with repeating this parody, chapter after chapter, is that the resulting book is 
no longer a parody of the martial spirit, but just another plug for the 
military.&quot; (Moorcock 1978, P.S. 1978)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Bill himself, a hard-pressed trooper, surely 
owes something to Švejk.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Of the 1987 novel &quot;Harrison says: &#39;the evil guys invade the plant [sic] which had their own system of Government which is right out of the
text book! It's anarchy. It has a bad name. But no one knows a thing about anarchism these days. That world is a world
of hard working anarchy. Every single character there is right out of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannia</i>. And not one person
ever noticed. So much for saying you hate anarchy! This was just pure text book anarchism. So now you know more
about anarchy.&#39;&quot; (Dan Clore)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The word 
itself, though, is never used. The prevailing political theory—developed by an 
artificial intelligence—is described as 'Individual Mutualism'. There is no 
state, no law, no army and no police force. One of the lead characters is called Stirner. The invaders are on the point of defeat by the means of passive 
resistance, when the League Navy turns up and takes the credit.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">A 
lightweight potboiler—though
<a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/">
Teflon</a> considers it a &quot;well thought out book about mutualist anarchism and 
nonviolent resistance disguised as escapist sci-fi.&quot;</p>
<br>
<h3>M. John Harrison: <i>&#39;</i>The Ash Circus&#39; (1971); <i>The Centauri Device</i> (1975)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">&#39;The Ash Circus&#39; is a short story featuring Moorcock&#39;s 
character Jerry Cornelius; there is brief reference to William Godwin.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Centauri Device </i>is, unusually, an explicitly anarchist space opera. Captain John Truck is the only human with the Centauran genes capable
of arming and triggering the ultimate weapon, the Centauri device. Pursued by the powers that be, he finally explodes
the device, concluding that none of them should have it. Anarchists play central roles—two chapters are devoted to
Swinburne Sinclair-Peter, the Interstellar Anarchist, who &quot;prowled the galaxy like a brilliant tiger&quot; (Panther edn: 74), and
the anarchist world of Howell, a 2-mile diameter asteroid midway between Sol and Centauri; in the final chapter Truck
himself becomes &quot;The Last Anarchist&quot; (187).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">According to Moorcock &quot;M. John Harrison is an 
anarchist and his books are full of anarchists—some of them very bizarre like 
the anarchist-aesthetes of <i>The Centauri Device</i>. Typical of the <i>New 
Worlds</i> school he could be described as an existential anarchist.&quot; (Moorcock 
1978)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Jacquetta Hawkes: <i>Providence Island</i> (1959)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">North of New Guinea an island is discovered and visited, 
on which survives the Magdalenian culture of the old stone age. Attempts by an 
American expeditionary force to take over are thwarted by a British 
archaeological group and the islanders&#39; telepathic powers.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">This well-meaning book was treated kindly by ADF in <i>Freedom</i>, who considered it &quot;worth reading purely as an 
emotional record&quot;, noting that &quot;Miss Hawkes is obviously wrung by the 
inhuman aspects of our culture . . .&quot;. (ADF, 1959)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nathaniel Hawthorne: &#39;The Artist of the Beautiful&#39; (1844)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">A watchmaker spends years creating an artificial butterfly 
but is relatively unmoved when it is destroyed by a child.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Herbert Read, writing in 1945, said:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">I believe that this particular tale of Hawthorne&#39;s is the 
author&#39;s deepest comment on his own work. He realised that he was only creating 
symbols inconsistent with his sceptical outlook on life. He realized that his 
works of art would not bear the test of reality. But nevertheless they did 
reveal, if only through the reactions they provoked, the reality of men&#39;s souls, 
the truth of the human heart.</p>
<h3>Robert A. Heinlein:<i> </i> &#39;Requiem&#39; (1940); <i> The Day After Tomorrow </i> (1941)<i>, 
Methuselah&#39;s Children </i> 
(1941/1958);<i> </i> 
&#39;Waldo&#39; (1942);<i> Red Planet </i> 
(1949); <i>The Puppet 
Masters </i> 
(1951); <i>Revolt in 2100</i> 
(1953); <i> Double Star </i> (1956); <i>Starship Troopers </i>(1959);<i> Stranger in a Strange Land </i> 
(1961);<i> Farnham&#39;s Freehold</i> (1964); <i> The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> 
(1966);
<i>Time Enough for Love</i> (1973); <i>Friday</i> (1982); <i>For Us, the Living</i> 
(2004; written 1939)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Heinlein was of the libertarian right, and has been treated harshly by anarchist critics. 
For John Pilgrim &quot;the appearance of Heinlein&#39;s <i>Day After Tomorrow </i>
proved beyond all doubt that Heinlein is that
virtually unique creature, a fascist science fiction writer&quot; (1963). Michael Moorcock, similarly, said that if someone sitting
opposite him on a tube train were reading <i>Mein Kampf </i>with obvious enjoyment and approval, it probably wouldn't
disturb him much more than if it were Heinlein they were reading. Heinlein's later stories, especially, he described as
paternalistic, xenophobic, misanthropic, and anti-libertarian. Moorcock 
expressed horror at the way radicals were taken in by Heinlein—&quot;even supporters 
of the Angry Brigade&quot; being among them; this was perhaps, he suggested, because 
Heinlein&#39;s vague prose allowed readers to interpret him in the way closest to 
their own sympathies.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&#39;Waldo&#39; is briefly mentioned in Moorcock 
1978.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Red Planet </i>won the Libertarian 
Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1996, as did <i>Methuselah&#39;s Children</i> 
in 1997 and <i>Time Enough for Love</i> in 1998, and <i>Requiem</i> in 2003.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Alex Comfort was thinking specifically of <i>
The Puppet Masters</i> when he mused, in 1961, that &quot;it is hard to tell whether 
some of the fantasies of science fiction are paranoiac or merely satirical&quot;.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">For M. Eagle, writing in <i>Freedom</i> in 
1969, Heinlein&#39;s <i>Revolt in 2100</i> &quot;describes the overthrow of a 
theocratic dictatorship in the USA and its replacement by the Covenant, by which 
all citizens can do anything they wish providing no harm is done to others. A 
social contract indeed!&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Double Star</i> is included in Evan 
Lampe&#39;s
<a href="http://tashqueedagg.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/robert-a-heinlein-double-star-franchise-politics-and-the-virtues-of-empire/">
blog</a>. Easterbrook describes it as &quot;Heinlein&#39;s first foray into explicitly 
libertarian thought&quot; (p555).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Starship Troopers</i> was attacked by both 
John Pilgrim and Michael Moorcock, in their seminal articles on anarchism and 
science fiction. For Pilgrim it is &quot;one of the very few examples of 
retrogressive, one might even say fascist thought, in the entire range of 
science fiction writing.&quot; He goes on to say that &quot;it could well be argued that 
part of the libertarian nature of science fiction is a built-in effect, for the 
setting of Heinlein&#39;s ideas in a science fiction medium show up, in sharper 
relief than mainstream fiction could ever do, the repulsive nature of his 
philosophy.&quot; (Pilgrim 1963). In 1966 he summed up this novel as &quot;brilliant but 
obnoxious&quot;. It is of course absolutely central to Moorcock&#39;s 1978 &#39;Starship 
Stormtroopers&#39;, which brackets Heinlein with John Wayne, John Ford, Ronald 
Reagan, and George Wallace. He says &quot;To be an anarchist, surely, is to reject 
authority but to accept self-discipline and community responsibility. To be a 
rugged individualist a la Heinlein and others is to be forever a child who must 
obey, charm and cajole to be tolerated by some benign, omniscient father&quot; . . . 
. </p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In 2014
<a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/books/starship-troopers-by-robert-heinlein">
Margaret Killjoy</a> presented a more ambivalent view. On the one hand he argued 
that that <em>&quot;Starship Troopers</em> is one of the more brilliant and 
influential arguments for hierarchy ever put to print. For that reason alone, 
it’s worth reading. Know your enemy.&quot; But on the other he found himself 
irresistibly drawn to the novel&#39;s romanticism, as he saw it, and was compelled 
to acknowledge that anarchism occupies an awkward liminal space with elements of 
both extreme leftwing and extreme rightwing values, which is shared, among 
others, with Heinlein.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Eagle, in 1969, found that <i>&quot;Stranger in a 
Strange Land </i>contains a beautiful religion or philosophy.&quot; The book tied 
for the 1987<i> </i>Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In <i>Farnham&#39;s Freehold</i> a nuclear attack 
propels a US family into a future society where blacks rule and whites are kept 
as slaves and bred for food. Highly offensive and reactionary, it is if anything 
worse than <i>Starship Troopers. </i>For Moorcock, &quot;It&#39;s not such a big step, for 
instance, from Farnham&#39;s Freehold to Hitler&#39;s Lebensraum.&quot; (Moorcock 1978)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress </i>is one of Heinlein's more acceptable books, and one to which a version of anarchism is
central—a blend of individualist anarchism and Jeffersonian democracy that Heinlein calls 'rational anarchism'. The story
concerns the successful lunar war of independence, and owes much to the historical precedent of the American
revolution. For Robert Shea,</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&nbsp;. . . the picture of an anarchist society on the 
moon in <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> is . . . believable. This is one <i>
sort</i> of anarchism, at any rate . . . This Wild West Anarchism wouldn&#39;t 
appeal to all anarchists, but it does give us a chance to experience one way 
that a society without a government might work. Many anarchists like it so much 
they suggest it to non-anarchists as introductory reading.&quot; (Shea 1980:0)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Like most revolutions, though, the lunar one only results in a substitution at the top.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">A key character in <i>Moon</i>, Professor 
Bernardo de la Paz, is said to have been based on the real-life libertarian 
Robert LeFevre, who had been a neighbour of Heinlein&#39;s. Ken MacLeod says 
this work had an influence on David Friedman and other theorists of 
anarcho-capitalism, &quot;a significant minority strand in modern libertarianism&quot; (<a href="biblio.htm#Macleod 2003">MacLeod 
2003</a>); but Jeff Riggenbach of the 
Mises Institute has suggested that, influential on libertarianism as Heinlein 
clearly was, he was probably not a libertarian himself, and that at the time he 
was writing works of this period he may well have been under the influence of 
his third wife, Virginia. (<a href="http://mises.org/daily/4428">Riggenbach</a>)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The book tied for the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1983.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Time Enough for Love</i> is a long-winded 
and tiresome novel, chronicling the 2360-year life of Lazarus Long, a Heinlein 
mouthpiece. There is an objectionable passage, in one of the extracts from 
Long&#39;s notebooks, which should be committed to memory by anyone inclined to 
describe Heinlein as an anarchist:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">Those who refuse to support and defend a state have no 
claim to protection by that state. Killing an anarchist or a pacifist should not 
be defined as &quot;murder&quot; in a legalistic sense. The offence against the state, if 
any, would be &quot;Using deadly weapons inside city limits,&quot; or &quot;Creating a traffic 
hazard,&quot; or &quot;Endangering bystanders,&quot; or other misdemeanour. [Second 
Intermission]</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Friday</i> is better, and certainly 
readable.
<a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/books/starship-troopers-by-robert-heinlein">
			Killjoy</a> comments that &quot;one of the important life lessons he imparts in
			<em>Friday</em> is that &quot;everyone is bisexual.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>For Us, the Living</i> was Heinlein&#39;s first novel, but 
remained unpublished until 2004, after his death. Curiosity value only, really, 
but interesting for anyone steeped in Heinlein who wants to see the genesis of 
his later work. This is the only Heinlein work included in Bould&#39;s <i>
<a href="biblio.htm#Red Planets">Red Planets</a></i> reading list. Bould refers 
to it as &quot;this long-unpublished anti-racist, anti-clerical, nudist utopian 
novel, advocating a Social Credit system with which to moderate capitalism&quot;, but 
also notes its &quot;already problematic feminism.&quot; Also referenced in Reddit Anarchy

<h3>James Hilton: <i>Lost Horizon</i> (1933)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Ethel Mannin wrote that &quot;In modern times there has been 
the glimpse of a free Utopia in James Hilton&#39;s novel, <i>Lost Horizon</i>, but 
it is a glimpse only, making no claim to being a detailed picture of an ideal 
commonwealth&quot; . . . (Mannin 1944: 40)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Lost Horizon</i> is a story of longevity 
in a Tibetan Christian/Buddhist lamasery, an idyllic community. Mannin rather 
overstates the freedom of the Utopia: the political system is flexible, but not 
anarchist. It is defined by one of the visitors to Shangri La as &quot;. . . a rather 
loose and elastic autocracy, operated from the lamasery with a benevolence that 
was almost casual&quot;, and the lama Chang comments that &quot;we believe that to govern 
perfectly it is necessary to avoid governing too much&quot; (c. VI). The idea of 
straightforwardly not governing doesn&#39;t arise.</p>

<h3>Russell Hoban: <i>Riddley Walker</i> (1980)<br>
</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">This wonderful post-apocalyptic novel was one of three sf 
novels selected for mention by Kelly Rose Pflug-Back, of the Fifth Estate collective, for a 
<a href="http://www.fifthestate.org/archive/387-summer-2012/anarchist-reading-list-fifth-estate-staff/">Summer 2012 anarchist reading list</a>

Time</i>).</p>

<h3>T. Shirby Hodge (pseudonym of Roger Sherman Tracy): <i>
<a href="http://archive.org/stream/whitemansburdens00trac/whitemansburdens00trac_djvu.txt">The White Man's Burden. A Satirical Forecast</a> </i>(1915)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">. . . &quot;set in 5000 CE, by which 
period the warlike and primitive white races have been restricted to North 
America while, in black-dominated Africa, anarchism and scientific genius have 
generated a utopian world.&quot; (<a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/Entry/hodge_t_shirby">SFE</a>)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">An unusual and surprisingly interesting work, 
it&#39;s as much scientific romance as utopia, but the anarchism is quite explicit, 
and explicitly endorsed, with a whole chapter entitled &#39;Anarchy&#39;. Perhaps 
improbably, government had simply been &#39;abolished&#39;, as the future society came 
to realise it would be better off without it. The &#39;White Man&#39;s Burden&#39; of the 
title is revealed on the final page (no surprise by then, so it&#39;s scarcely a 
spoiler) as Himself.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Discussed by <a href="biblio.htm#Bould">Mark Bould</a> in 
2010, who concluded that &quot;The equality Tracy hints at is that of the oppressed, 
regardless of color or sex.&quot;</p>

<h3>James P. Hogan: <i>Voyage from Yesteryear</i> (1982); 
<i>The Multiplex Man</i> (1992)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Voyage from Yesteryear </i>describes an attempt by Terrans to recolonise a planet settled by humans some years before, in which the authoritarianism of the new colonists is thwarted by the libertarianism of the old. The planet&#39;s social system is essentially anarchy, but details are not dwelt upon.

<p class="aplaintext">Satirical utopian Hollow Earth story. The best part is the

<h3>Cecelia Holland: <i>Floating</i> <i>Worlds</i> (1976)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">A complex story of conflict between the inner and outer planets of the solar system, featuring a post-revolution anarchist Earth. The book presents an interesting contrast between libertarian and authoritarian society. Most of the book is set in the empire of the Styths on the outer planets, rather than on anarchist Earth. Neither side is presented as an ideal, and authorial judgment is not explicit. Earth's anarchy, in particular, is perhaps—like Le Guin's Anarres—an ambiguous utopia, in which the Committee for the Revolution has become just a vestigial government (Sphere edn: 13). Unlike Anarres, though, Earth's society is closer to anarcho-capitalism than anarchist communism. The anarchy is in any case essentially no more than the backdrop. Robert Shea considered this novel 
&quot;not anarchist propaganda&quot;, but nevertheless felt it &quot;presents a persuasive picture of an anarchist society&quot;. 
&quot;The testing to which Holland subjects her anarchist community is so severe that 
it is finally destroyed by invaders. But not before we have learned to love it 
and to mourn its passing—4000 years in the future.&quot; (19)</p>

<p class="aplaintext">
This very slight sketch was first published in <i>The Rebel</i> of Boston, in 
March–April 1896. The title says all that is necessary. One notes that exhibits 
are displayed by association branch number rather than by country. The workerism 
of the imagined future society verges on Stalinism.</p>

<h3>E. Holt-White: <i>The Woman who Saved the World </i>(1914)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Anarchist conspiracy story. Various British institutions are destroyed; the Houses of Parliament are blown up by rocket, but no MPs are killed. The chief culprit, Salvator, the unknown King of the Anarchists, turns out to be Chief of the Russian Secret Police, and a puppet of the Russian reactionary party, his purpose being to destroy England as a haven for anarchists. Olga, the eponymous Woman, is his sister; she finally shoots her brother to prevent his assassination of the prime minister, then kills herself. Poor and derivative.</p>

Hopkinson: <i>Brown Girl in the Ring </i>(1998); <i>Midnight Robber </i>(2000);
<i>The Salt Roads</i> (2003)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Brown Girl in the Ring</i> is described as Caribbean 
magical realism. Fine writing, very readable, but for my taste the magic is at the 
expense of the sf.</p>

Sadie the Goat,

reviewing</a> the film for The Anarcho-Geek Review, enjoyed the film&#39;s 
anti-authoritarianism, and felt that, especially for the intended YA audience, 
&quot;It’s hard to imagine a kid not walking out of Hunger Games able to see where 
the anarchists are coming from, if they’re able to make the connections between 
the movie and the real world.&quot; However, &quot;For people who are already radicals, 
revolutionaries, and anarchists, I think this movie may be a frustrating 
experience&quot;, with the &quot;resolution too perfect, and too unattainable.&quot;</p>

less fun&quot; than its predecessors:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">[. . .] the worst thing about the third part of the Hunger 
Games is that there aren’t any hunger games. It’s just a movie about revolution 
instead. Considering that the hunger games are an awful thing and revolutions 
are something us anarchists are known for encouraging, this is a strange 
statement. But frankly, the battle royale under the omniscient gaze of an evil 
dictator made for good fiction. </p>
<p class="blockquote">Revolution can too, it turns out.</p>
<h3>Aldous Huxley: <i>Brave New World</i> (1932); <i>After Many a Summer</i> 
(1939);<i> Ape and Essence</i> (1948); <i>Island</i> (1962)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Huxley has a significant place at the periphery of anarchism. Influenced to some extent by anarchist thought and experiment, he came in his turn to influence a later generation,  the libertarian counter-culture of the 1960s. Already familiar with Godwin, Tolstoy, Proudhon, and Kropotkin, for Huxley it was the Spanish Civil War which prompted a specific reappraisal of anarchism. In a response to a questionnaire circulated to British writers by the 
<i>Left Review</i> in summer 1937, in which authors were asked to take sides, he responded: 
&quot;My sympathies are, of course, with the Government side, especially with the Anarchists; for Anarchism seems to me much more likely to lead to desirable social change than highly centralized, dictatorial Communism.&quot; (Huxley 1969:423). In December Huxley's response was reprinted on the front page of the British anarchist paper 
<i>Spain and the World </i>(Huxley 1937-12-10). Emma Goldman responded enthusiastically to Huxley's statement, writing to the latter in early 1938 to thank him: 
&quot;Without wishing to be pushing, I cannot refrain from assuring you that this statement of yours is an event in my life of first-rate importance: indeed, I feel that it was worth fighting for fifty years to be able to call one a comrade who is so outstanding as a creative artist and who comes from a family of libertarians.&quot; (Porter:309) Albert Meltzer records, however, that when she tried 
&quot;to rope him into activity for the Spanish Anarchists&quot;, &quot;he ran off like a startled fawn&quot; (Meltzer 1976: 24) 
</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Subsequent non-fiction works  <i>Ends and Means
</i>(1937), <i>Science, Liberty and Peace </i>(1947), <i>Brave New World Revisited
</i>(1949), though never directly anarchist, explored collateral issues such as pacifism, decentralisation, the role of science and technology, property distribution, and ecology. 
</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In the seminal dystopia <i>Brave New World
</i>the Savage, who has taught himself classic Western culture, encounters the new world of babies in bottles, soma and sex, is revolted, and is finally driven to suicide. In his 1946 introduction to the work Huxley said that if he were to rewrite it he would include a third option for the Savage: a community of exiles and refugees, in which 
&quot;economics would be decentralist and Henry-Georgian, politics Kropotkinesque and cooperative.&quot; (Huxley 1946: 8)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Among anarchists, the most enthusiastic discussion of this work came from George Woodcock, for whom it was 
&quot;the first warning vision of the kind of mindless, materialistic existence a society dominated by technological centralization might produce&quot; (Woodcock 1975: 458). Of the big three dystopias (with Zamyatin&#39;s
<i>We </i>and Orwell's <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>) it is the weakest and most overrated. 
</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">George Woodcock linked <i>After Many a Summer
</i>with <i>Ends and Means </i>and <i>Brave New World Revisited </i>as writings in which 
&quot;Huxley explicitly accepted the validity of the anarchist critique of the existing society&quot; (Woodcock 1975: 458); and felt that it was through this novel especially that Huxley transmitted the libertarian attitude to the 1960s (Woodcock 1977: 52). 
David Goodway sees Huxley (with Lewis Mumford) as one of the forerunners of the 
&#39;new anarchism&#39; of the late 20th century, with its emphasis on biology, ecology, 
anthropology and alternative technology, in a line through Paul Goodman and Alex 
Comfort to Colin Ward and, especially, Murray Bookchin (Goodway: 232).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i> Ape and Essence </i>is a post-holocaust dystopia, presented in the form of a film script. For Woodcock it was 
&quot;a book which cannot be ignored by the libertarian, for it is one of the most bitter and sincere satirical attacks on the modern state and its centralising tendencies that has been produced in recent years&quot; (Woodcock 1949).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Island </i>is Huxley's utopia, ostensibly an anti-<i>Brave New World</i>, founded on tantric yoga, Buddhist behaviourism, and psychedelic drugs. The economy is cooperative, the political system a federation of self-governing geographical, professional and economic units, and religion centred on individual experience. For Woodcock
<i>Island </i>&quot;was the nearest any writer approached to an anarchist Utopia since William Morris wrote 
<i>News from Nowhere</i>&quot; (Woodcock 1975: 458). For Goodway, too, it was &quot;the 
first fully realized libertarian utopia&quot; since Morris&#39;s work; for him the 
society Huxley presented &quot;is a society in which I personally would be delighted 
to live.&quot; Very much a novel of the 60s, it is in a broad sense anarchistic, but the formula presented—sex, drugs and religion—is far from liberating, and objectively it is not that distant from
<i>Brave New World</i>.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
<br>
</p>
<h3>Edward Hyams: The<i> Final Agenda</i> (1973); <i>Morrow&#39;s Ants</i> (1975)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Hyams was well-versed in the history of anarchism. His non-fiction publications include
<i>Killing No Murder. A Study of Assassination as a Political Means </i>(1969), 
<i>A Dictionary of Modern Revolution </i>(1973), <i>The Millennium Postponed </i>(1974), 
<i>Terrorists and Terrorism (</i>1975), and his final work, unfinished at his death,
<i>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. His Revolutionary Life, Mind and Works </i>(1979).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">It&#39;s worth looking a bit more closely at <i>
The Millennium Postponed</i>, which is a history of socialism in its wider 
interpretation. Hyams exhibits a rather low opinion of some anarchists: Godwin 
is &quot;a mere theorist&quot; (Hyams 1974:11), Bakunin an imbecile, &quot;a comic figure, the 
clown of socialism&quot; (93), and a &quot;bit of a fraud&quot; (93). Proudhon, however, is 
&quot;very great&quot; (33), and &quot;the most brilliant of the anarchists&quot; (88). And 
Kropotkin&#39;s work &quot;is of the first importance today, in the New Left context&quot; 
(102). Hyams here clearly finds anarchism seductive. He considers that 
&quot;re-examination of anarchist theory as a possible means of ridding ourselves of 
the foul parasite on human life (is) a matter of urgency&quot; (80); and in 
particular &quot;it may be that anarcho-syndicalism, as a possible way to egalitarian 
social justice combined with the optimum measure of personal liberty, should be 
one of the roads to re-explore&quot;. (153) But in his conclusion he draws back: &quot;Now 
although the anarchist philosophers are, without question, morally correct in 
condemning and wishing to be rid of the State as unavoidable evil because more 
or less oppressive, . . . it is a fact that since society has to be 
administered, some kind of State apparatus seems essential.&quot; (228)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In <i>The Final Agenda </i>an international terrorist group blackmails the world's governments by means of tactically-placed H-bombs into surrendering part of Brazil and $32 billion, the land to set up a free country, the money as reparations for the wretched of the earth. It was aptly described by A.B. in the 
<i>Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review </i>as &quot;profoundly disappointing because it 
is nothing more than a misleading fantasy despite its supposedly realist 
hypothesis, and is most un-Anarchist at core even with all the quotes and 
references to great Anarchist thinkers.&quot; A.B. concluded that &quot;It is very sad 
that such a sympathetic writer who makes telling points against the State's 
hypocrisy of violence and against the parliamentary fraud should in the end 
present such an elitist and distorted version of Anarchism.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In <i>Morrow&#39;s Ants </i>a billionaire industrialist fascinated with ant-colonies constructs a human formicarium-city, with a view to a millennial subjugation of the individual in the mass. The novel's reflections on motivations for tyrannicide, on the nature of freedom, and on the relationship of the individual to society, are of considerable interest for anarchists. Much superior to 
<i>The Final Agenda</i>. If there is any doubt about the metaphor of the 
formicarium, a sentence from Hyams&#39;s <i>The Millennium Postponed</i>, published 
the year before <i>Morrow&#39;s Ants</i>, points the moral. The anarchist path must 
be explored again, he says, &quot;For we are confronted by a choice: either the 
capitalist-communist hive, anthill, termitory; or a society which is free, if 
relatively poor, because it denies authority to any power but the individual 
conscience implanted in men by the beautiful fiction of immanent justice.&quot; (143)</p>

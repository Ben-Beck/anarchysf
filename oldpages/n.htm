</span><b>1984, dir. Hayao Miyazaki; 2005, unedited and redubbed version)</b></h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Set a thousand years after an environmental disaster, this 
appealing anime film tells the story of Nausicaä, the young princess of the 
Valley of the Wind, who is opposed by a neighbouring kingdom that seeks to 
eradicate a jungle full of giant mutant insects, as she tries to resolve the 
conflict amicably whilst protecting the local fauna.</p>

<p class="aplaintext">Reviewed by Connor Owens at
<a href="https://solarpunkanarchists.com/tag/anime/">solarpunkanarchists.com</a>, 
for whom it &quot;embodies all the best traits of the anime films that came after it: 
ecological awareness, links between ecocide and the militaristic desire to 
dominate nature, and the aspiration to adopt a cooperative relationship to the 
natural world instead of one based on hierarchy and destruction.&quot;</p>

<h3>Josef Nesvadba: 'In the footsteps of the abominable snowman' (1964)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Story of telepathic yetis, part of which is set in Spain during the Civil War. Speaks unusually warmly of the anarchists:
one character says &quot;&#39;They were men of courage and I remember them often. Naturally they had no idea that reason and
intellect would get them nowhere.&#39;&quot;(1979 NEL pb collection of the same title: 169)<br>

<i>Red Shift</i> (1977)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Daily Lives </i>is a short tetralogy, set in a near-future alternate-world central Asian land. Strong on ecological and (unusually) traditional-religious values, the anarchist influence is explicitly acknowledged. Written in a fragmented, poetic and impressionistic
style, it&#39;s an interesting and important modern utopia.
<i>Daily Lives</i> is preceded by an introductory work, <i>Red Shift, </i>in 
which characters include &#39;Errico Malatesta&#39; and &#39;Sandy Berkman&#39;.</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">&quot;While <i>Daily Lives</i> is not widely 
		known, it is one of the most important contributions to both literary 
		and theoretical utopianism.&quot; (Clark 2009: 21-2) It was a significant 
		influence on Ursula K. Le Guin, who is on record as saying that &quot; . . . 
		Nghsi-Altai is in some respects the very place I was laboriously trying 
		to get to, and yet lies in quite the opposite direction . . .&quot;. (Le Guin 
		1982)</p>

<p class="aplaintext">Reviewed by Alex Peak, for whom &quot;The teleplay’s bleak 
ending demonstrates why we all must, at all times, be sceptical of government, 
and be wary of allowing it to have power.&nbsp;For power, in the hands of a state, 
invariably means the power to oppress.&quot; Peak, citing Professor Tony Shaw&#39;s <i>
British Cinema and the Cold War: The State, Propaganda and Consensus</i>, notes 
that it was this broadcast that &quot;effectively &#39;launched&#39; Orwell as a &#39;public&#39;

that the Free Park experiment without copseyes (which results in chaos) is too short an experiment to pass judgement
on anarchy, at the conclusion of the story he recants, and declares anarchy unworkable because unstable.</p>

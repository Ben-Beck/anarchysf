<h3>
José 
Saramago: <i>Blindness </i>(1995); <i>Seeing </i>(2004)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In <i>Blindness</i> everyone suddenly and inexplicably 
goes blind, and their world rapidly becomes a foul and smelly place where 
everyone simply fends for themselves as best they can. In a <i>Guardian</i> 
interview copied to the anarchysf mailing list in 2004 Ursula Le Guin, asked to 
recommend modern authors who best represent the spirit of the Tao, singled out 
Saramago for mention: &quot;I think part of what appeals to me so much in the novels 
of José Saramago is that his people go along with events without trying to 
&quot;master&quot; them<font face="Verdana">—</font>they do by not doing. The woman who is 
the central character of <i>Blindness</i> is truly a great hero to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Seeing</i> is included in 
<i><a href="k.htm#Killjoy">Killjoy'</a>s
</i>list of stories that explore anarchist 
societies. It explores the consequences of an election in which the majority cast 
blank votes. Not really sf, though.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Although according to <i>
<a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/saramago_jose">SFE</a> </i>
Saramago self-identified as a &quot;libertarian communist&quot;, he joined the Portuguese 
Communist Party in 1969 and remained a member until his death.</p>

women&#39;s (and feminist) anthology of sf&quot; (Curtoni 1978: 26); but he obviously 
knew the work only by repute, since he attributed it to Joanna Russ. Sargent&#39;s

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw: <i>
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13084/13084-8.txt">Back to Methuselah</a></i> (1921)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Shaw was familiar with anarchist literature—references to Godwin, Bakunin, Proudhon, Kropotkin, Tucker, and Tolstoy
abound in his work; among these he was on fairly close personal terms with Kropotkin and Tucker; and in the 1880s he
was familiar with British anarchists such as Charlotte Wilson, Henry Seymour and Joseph Lane.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Several times he
contributed articles to anarchist publications: &#39;What&#39;s in a Name? (How an 
Anarchist Might Put It)&#39; in 1885 to <i>The Anarchist</i>, Britain&#39;s first 
anarchist paper; &#39;Strikes. (From the State Socialist Point of View)&#39; in 1890 to
<i>Freedom</i>; &#39;The Quintessence of Ibsenism&#39; in 1891 to the American<i> 
Liberty</i> and &#39;Why I Am a Social-Democrat&#39; in 1894 to the British <i>Liberty</i>.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The first of these appeared to be 
pro-anarchist, and was later published by anarchists as &#39;Anarchism versus State 
Socialism&#39;; Shaw always subsequently claimed that the views he had described 
were not his own. By 1888 he was firmly entrenched in his own brand of Fabianism—he 
wrote in a letter that &quot;I am no anarchist: I am a practical politician&quot; (Shaw 
1965: 184); and in the same year he gave a lecture at the Communist Club on 
&#39;Anarchism refuted&#39; (Amalric 1977). In 1891 he published &#39;The Impossibilities of 
Anarchism&#39;, his definitive denunciation; in this work he found individualist 
anarchism unacceptable because it failed to tackle the problem of inequitable 
distribution, and communist anarchism also unacceptable since it failed to offer 
an incentive to labour without coercion. His opinions of anarchism received no 
later substantial revision.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Back to Methuselah</i> is an episodic dream of human evolution from Genesis to the 32nd millennium; humanity by 31920
had outgrown corporeal life and exists on a spiritual plane only. It has been suggested that some of the Lamarckian
ideas used here by Shaw may have been suggested by Kropotkin, who had published a number of articles on the
inheritance of acquired characteristics in <i>The Nineteenth Century and After</i> in 1910 (Hulse). Woodcock considered that
the theme Shaw chose for development in this play was Godwinian (Woodcock 1962: 86).</p>

<a name="Sheckley"></a>Robert Sheckley: &#39;The Seventh Victim&#39; (1953); 'Skulking Permit' (1954) <img border="0" src="../anarchy_symbol.GIF" width="23" height="21">; 'A Ticket to Tranai' (1955);
<i>Untouched by Human Hands</i> (1955); &#39;Pilgrimage to Earth&#39; (1956); &#39;The Prize 
of Peril&#39; (1958); &#39;The People Trap&#39; (1968); 
'The Resurrection Machine' (1989); 'Simul City' (1990)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">&#39;The Seventh Victim&#39; is among those cited in Curtoni&#39;s 
bibliography. 
It concerns a society in which murder has been institutionalised as, 
paradoxically, a means of reducing crime. The 1966 novelisation (<i>The Tenth 
Victim)</i>, instanced by Curtoni, is distinctly inferior.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In 'Skulking Permit' a backwater planet is re-contacted by Imperial Earth; the inhabitants attempt to revive old Earth
customs—crime, police, etc.—but fail by misunderstanding the (lack of) Point Of It All; Earth abandons the attempt to
conscript colonists. It is a splendid anarchic story: the colonists have lived without authority so long that there's
manifestly no need for it.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">'A Ticket to Tranai' features an exotic utopia in a remote corner of the galaxy; an Earth visitor is suitably freaked out.
Society on Tranai is minimal-statist or anarcho-capitalist, though in distinctive ways: government is restricted to minor
matters like care of the aged and beautifying the landscape, and is financed by tax collectors who are literally robbers in
black silk masks; government officials wear explosive badges which will be detonated on a majority vote in favour of
assassination. Though the story has attractive elements, it is vitiated by sexism—married women are kept in a stasis-field purdah, a state which is subject to only token criticism.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Untouched by Human Hands</i>—Sheckley&#39;s 
first short-story collection—is listed in Curtoni&#39;s bibliography. As well as 
&#39;The Seventh Victim&#39;, &#39;Keep Your Shape&#39; is noteworthy as a nice parable of 
liberation and the throwing off of formalist shackles. In general, it&#39;s a good 
collection.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&#39;Pilgrimage to Earth&#39; is referred to in Curtoni&#39;s article. Love is purveyed to tourists as a commodity, which not 
surprisingly proves disillusioning.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&quot;The television quiz becomes the occasion for 
the release of that cruelty which is so functional to the system&quot;—such is Curtoni&#39;s succinct description of &#39;The Prize of Peril&#39;.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In &#39;The People Trap&#39; possession of land 
becomes the reward of successful competition in a ritual race. The bandit leader 
Steinmetz declares, with Sheckley&#39;s tongue in his cheek, that &quot;Rules is rules, 
even in an anarchy.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The two later stories include Bakunin as 
a character. Both are included in 
<i> 
<a href="k.htm#Killjoy">Killjoy,</a></i>&#39;s
list of stories that feature sympathetic 
anarchist characters. 'The Resurrection Machine' features the 
resurrection of simulacra of Bakunin and Cicero; the virtual Bakunin is 
mistreated by one of the experimenters, whose colleague retaliates by &#39;freeing&#39; 
him within the computer network. The story is part of the themed <i>Time Gate</i> 
anthology, edited by Robert Silverberg with Bill Fawcett, and Bakunin reappears later in the volume in Pat Murphy&#39;s 'How I 
Spent My Summer Vacation.' 'Simul City' appears in the sequel volume <i>Time 
Gate, Vol. 2, Dangerous Interfaces,</i> where Bakunin plays a lesser role; in 
other stories in this volume, by Anne McCaffrey ('Pedigreed Stallion') and Karen 
Haber ('Simbody to Love') Bakunin has little more than a walk-on role; 
McCaffrey&#39;s story must be unique in including an encounter between Bakunin and 
Margaret Thatcher . . . .</p>

<br>

<h3>Mary Shelley: <i>
<a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/ghostseer01schiuoft">Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus</a></i> 
(1818, rev. 1831); <i>
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18247/18247.txt">The Last Man</a></i> (1826)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In one respect Mary Shelley is the prime example of association between sf and anarchism: for the mother of science fiction was daughter to the father of anarchism, William Godwin, and wife to the Godwinian Percy B. Shelley. Critical opinions differ, however, as to how much Godwin's philosophy influenced her works, or for that matter P.B. Shelley's own brand of Godwinism. 
Though the influence on her upbringing must have been considerable, she chose to 
keep her distance from radicalism. As she wrote in her journal, &quot;I believe we 
are sent here to educate ourselves, and that self-denial, and disappointment, 
and self-control, are a part of our education; that it is not by taking away all 
restraining law that our improvement is to be achieved; and, though many things 
need great amendment, I can by no means go so far as my friends would have me.&quot; 
(quoted in Spark 1952: 5)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Frankenstein,</i> now widely regarded as the first work of modern science fiction, is too well-known to need description here. On its appearance it bore a dedication to Godwin; and it&#39;s noteworthy that Shelley had been re-reading her father's great work<i> Political Justice</i> in 1817, whilst writing <i>Frankenstein:</i> one entry in her journal (1817-04-13) actually reads 
&quot;Correct Frankenstein; read Political Justice&quot; (Shelley 1947: 78). Godwin himself praised <i>Frankenstein</i> in his letters to his daughter. On 1822-11-15 he described the novel as 
&quot;a fine thing; it was compressed, muscular, and firm; nothing relaxed and weak; no proud flesh.&quot; 
(Marshall 1889: II.52) And by 1823-02-14 he could write that &quot;<i>Frankenstein</i> is universally known, and though it can never be a book for vulgar reading, is everywhere respected.&quot; (ibid.: II.68). 
Most recently (2013), John Zerzan has described <i>Frankenstein</i> as &quot;a 
classic warning about the hubris of technology&#39;s combat against nature&quot;.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Last Man,</i> though historically important in sf as a very early post-catastrophe story, is overwhelmingly tedious, and was understandably out of print for over a century. The character of Lionel's father, as described in the novel's opening pages, has been seen as a portrait of William Godwin (Luke 1965: xii). In an 1824 letter from Godwin to the author he gave at best lukewarm opinions on the extracts she had sent him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Lewis Shiner: <i>Frontera</i> (1984); <i>Deserted Cities of the Heart</i> (1988); <i>Slam </i>(1990)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Frontera</i> was one of the first cyberpunk novels, and 
was among those discussed by Donahoo and Etheridge in their 1992
<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jIOa_XhDNLMC&pg=PT168&lpg=PT168&dq=&quot;Lewis+Shiner+and+the+'Good'+Anarchist&quot;&source=bl&ots=SuW2VPiDhP&sig=5ZFAdy0B4exQxb9dbLGAD9kzuBU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FtuZVIXIFam07gaFy4HYDg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&quot;Lewis Shin">
&#39;Lewis Shiner and the &quot;Good&quot; Anarchist&#39;</a>.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Characters in <i>Deserted Cities of the Heart </i>have 
been seen as &quot;perfect anarchists, demanding no pattern or meaning but accepting 
what <i>is</i>—in fact, they are working to make their version of acceptance a 
reality.&quot; According to Donahoo and Etheridge, &quot;Shiner sees anarchy as a 
cleansing force necessary for the destruction of decaying social structures that 
are no longer viable, so that a newer, more functional society can evolve.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Slam</i> itself isn't actually sf. But it's hugely enjoyable, 
so I'm happy to include it here.<i> </i>The novel is explicitly influenced by Bob Black's <i>The Abolition of Work, </i>
as acknowledged by Black<i>. &quot;</i>Shiner 
says: 'In fact, I was at a cyberpunk conference in Leeds this summer and one of 
the participants gave a paper on my stuff. It was not a terribly theoretical 
paper; his point was that all my books involve anarchy to one degree or another. 
The anarchist is perceived as a positive force to reawaken a stagnant society. 
He found this in a great number of my works. I'll buy into that, particularly 
since the novel I'd already finished—Slam, which he hadn't seen—is a blatant 
novel about anarchy. Genre distinctions or the presence or absence of certain 
tropes in a work is a very minor detail compared to the other stuff.'&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Shiner is reluctant to self-identify as anarchist, but he 
is a paid-up member of the IWW, and has stated that &quot;I look to anarchists for 
inspiration, for those gestures of defiance that I can use in my work&quot; 
(interview in <a href="k.htm#Killjoy">
Killjoy</a>, 2009).</p>

<h3>John Shirley: <i>Transmaniacon</i> (1979); <i>Three-Ring Psychus</i> (1980);
<i>New Taboos plus </i>(2013)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">The protagonist of <i>Transmaniacon</i> 
is described as &quot;punk, anarchic, exorbitant, his mind evacuated of normal 
constraints, death-loving.&quot; (<a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/Entry/shirley_john">SFE</a>)</p>
<p class="aplaintext"> &nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"> <i>Three-Ring Psychus</i> is a real 
curiosity, with a vision of &#39;The Great Unweighting&#39;, in which Jung&#39;s collective 
unconscious asserts itself and allows people control over their own gravitation,

Blissett&#39;s Medium.com review was reproduced in the online <i>

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">While I can see some virtue in some selfishness, and I 
believe in independent thinking and constantly critiquing government, I think we 
still have a profound need for a well-organized, democratic, centralized 
government. I have a streak of socialist in me, but I believe in a free market 
modified by regulation; capitalism modified by, for example, socialized 
medicine, social safety nets. It&#39;s not a choice between government and anarchy. 
It&#39;s about allowing some space for the anarchic in a structured society.</p>

<p class="aplaintext">In the Facebook Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum&#39;s 2016 
discussion on the best sci-fi ever committed to film, this was listed by Rich 
Dana. It&#39;s also the favourite film of a contributor to FB&#39;s Sci-Fi Libertarian

<a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/silent_running">SFE</a>: &quot;the film 
is morally dubious, scientifically unsound and sociologically implausible.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Alan Sillitoe: <i>Travels in Nihilon</i> (1971)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">According to Sargent (153), this is a satire on anarchism 
(nihilism). Actually, it's nothing at all to do with anarchism, but is rather a 
satirical utopia (not really sf) about a nation of self-styled nihilists. Its 
perverse logic can nevertheless be quite beguiling.</p>

<br>

<h3>Robert Silverberg: 'The Songs of <i>Summer</i>&#39; (1956); <i>Hawksbill Station</i> (1968);
<i>Dying Inside</i> (1972)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In <i>The Songs of Summer
</i>a man from the present is projected into a far-future post-holocaust world, and attempts to reinstate government. The community psychically isolates him in his own fantasy. The future society is very sparse and individualistic; this and the far-future setting imply no belief on Silverberg's part in either the practicality or the desirability of anarchism.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Hawksbill Station is a penal colony for political dissidents from a future Syndicalist USA, located a billion years in the past. With a change of government, and the discovery of a method of sending people forward in time, it becomes possible for them to return. A couple of the dissidents were anarchists before their exile. One of these, the man who profoundly believed in individualism and the abolition of all political institutions (c. 7), has ironically been obliged to swallow his theory and acknowledge the value of team work. 
This individualist version of anarchism is the only one presented. Anarchists are shown in a fairly positive light in the novel, but this appears to be despite their beliefs.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">For
<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/page/19/">Zeke Teflon</a>, <i>Dying 
Inside</i> is &quot;a masterpiece of description and character development. It’s 
depressing, but it’s a masterpiece nonetheless&quot;.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Clifford D. Simak: &#39;Beachhead&#39; (1951); <i>City</i> (1952)</h3>

<p class="aplaintext">In &#39;Beachhead&#39;, members of a human survey party perceive as a threat the 
warning from aliens that they will never leave the planet; they soon learn that 
it was merely factual, as an unknown factor destroys all alloyed metals on the 
planet—which is why the aliens had not developed a technology. The humans&#39; smug 
confidence in their own faith is of no avail. For John Pilgrim this was a nice example of an SF writer 
cutting the scientist down to size. (Pilgrim 1963)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">According to Darren Jorgensen, writing 
in Bould &amp; Miéville, eds: <i>Red Planets </i>(201-2), Marxist Henri Lefebvre 
discussed a translation of <i>City</i> with the situationists, prior to the 
events of May 1968. Jorgensen writes:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">There is no causal relation between situationist praxis 
and <i>City</i>, and yet the two resonate with each other. <i>City</i>&#39;s 
description of a posthuman utopia run by machines and the actions of the 
situationists both realise a world without work. Thus the situationists allow us 
to read <i>City </i>literally, rather than metaphorically, as a realisation of 
that liberated consciousness that lies beyond capitalism. In playing a part in 
the situationist milieu, in informing the situationist experiments for 
re-imagining the city, Simak&#39;s <i>City</i> was part of a different continuum by 
which to think through the relationship of revolution to SF. This is a 
relationship of reciprocal exchange between text and revolution, as a novel 
informs a revolution that, in turn, enables a reading of the novel as 
revolutionary possibility.</p>


<h3>
B.F. Skinner: <i>Walden Two</i> (1958)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">
<i>Walden Two</i> is a provocative utopia based on experimentation in 
behavioural engineering. It&#39;s provocative because it&#39;s presented as a <i>e</i>utopia, 
to be admired, whereas many people, and most anarchists, would regard 
behavioural engineering as nightmarish totalitarian control. Frazier, Skinner&#39;s 
mouthpiece, denies &quot;that freedom exists at all&quot; (Macmillan pb edn, New York, 
1962: 257). In 1980 Skinner explained that</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">
If acting for the good of the group is positively reinforced, people will feel 
as free and worthy as possible. I am in favour of that. It is the best way to 
promote government by the people for the people.&quot; (Skinner 1980: 5)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
Despite this apparent opinion of Skinner&#39;s that freedom itself is 
just a weapon in the behaviourist&#39;s armoury, <i>Walden Two</i> presents 
arguments that anarchists need to be able to answer, and should be read with 
this in mind.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
John Sladek: 'Heavens Below: Fifteen Utopias' (1975)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">One of the fifteen is the one-page &#39;Utopia: A Financial Report&#39;, in which the four planned nations of Fascesia, Commund, Capitalia and Anarche are the subject of an experiment on the social institutions of Homo sapiens; it is successfully completed, Utopia closed, the inhabitants destroyed, and the experimenters move on to the social behaviour of armadillos. Anarche had not proved viable: it was found that 
&quot;Anarchers are evidently unstable, and frequently migrate to the other three nations.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&#39;Heavens Below&#39; is an entertaining mixture: 
&#39;Utopia: A Financial Report&#39; is too short to establish anything much, especially 
given the overall satirical/ironic cast of the story as a whole.</p>

<h3>Cordwainer Smith: <i>Instrumentality</i> series</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Smith&#39;s series, most recently assembled in two volumes (<i>Norstrilia, </i>and<i> 
The Rediscovery of Man: The Complete Short Fiction of Cordwainer Smith</i>), is an unfinished future history, mainly featuring &#39;underpeople&#39;—humans 
made from animal stock—in an unusual Chinese-influenced quasi-mythic narrative 
style. The stories are variable in quality, but some are superlative sf; 
nevertheless, they are basically right-wing in political orientation. Included 
in the <i><a href="biblio.htm#Bould">Red Planets</a></i> reading list.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">M. Eagle, in <i>Freedom,</i> found Smith&#39;s stories 
&quot;somewhat odd&quot; . . . (Eagle 1969) This is perhaps not surprising given the 
author&#39;s real identity as Paul M.A. Linebarger, godson to Sun Yat-sen, close 
confidant of Chiang Kai-shek, and an expert on psychological warfare, known to 
have done undocumented work for the CIA.</p>

<h3>L. Neil Smith: <i>The Probability Broach</i> (1980); <i>Pallas</i> (1993)</span>;
<i>Forge of the Elders</i> (2000)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Probability Broach</i> is a Parallel Earth story of an anarcho-capitalist society trying to influence our Earth, involving a Chandlerian cop. American free-market anarchism is integral to the work, involving informed discussion of the relative merits of minarchy and anarcho-capitalism; 
the general message is that &quot;A free, unregulated laissez-faire market should, 
and can take care of everything government claims to do, only better, cheaper, 
and without wrecking individual lives in the process: national defense, 
adjudication, pollution control, fire protection, and police . . . &quot; (del Rey 
edn: 3). There are bizarre aspects to the alternate history: the list of Presidents of the North American Confederacy include Lysander Spooner, Benjamin Tucker and Ayn Rand; the former king of the UK now has among his titles Anarch of the 
Commonwealth; Peter Kropotkin became a wealthy uranium miner in Antarctica (his alternate world widow is a principal character in the novel). The author seems obsessed with hardware—Lucy Kropotkin claims that 
&quot;freedom always calls for a little hardware&quot; (del Rey edn: 98); this may have something to do with Smith being an ex-police reservist, gunsmith and self-defence consultant.</p>

<p class="aplaintext"><i>Agent of Chaos</i> concerns an underground movement which ideologises 
entropy as leading to chaos, and fights against the total control of the 
Hegemony over the solar system. Said to have influenced young American 
radical-anarchists in the 1970s (Platt:70), though it&#39;s hard to see why; there 
is, however, a passage in chapter 11 in which the concept of freedom is linked 
to that of the infinity of the universe, which equation is perhaps at the root 
of the attractiveness of sf for many anarchists and libertarians.</p>

impossibly weak, artificial, repressive series [ . . . ] is a puzzling and sad 
symptom of an absence of both vitality and reflection.&quot; In particular, he finds 
&quot;repulsive&quot; &quot;its predication on a strict, martial hierarchy.&quot; Beyond that, 
though, &quot;What Star Trek conveys about technology is probably its most insidious

<p class="blockquote">Or consider <i>Star Trek</i>, that quintessence of

Americanized vision of a kinder, gentler Soviet Union, and above all, one that 
actually &quot;worked&quot;?</p>

almost no one seems to notice its absence.</p>

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The film is the subject of an academic essay in the 
October 1999 issue of <i>Anarchist Studies</i>: Paul-F. Tremlett&#39;s &#39;Borg: A 
Critical Encounter&#39; (<i>Anarchist Studies</i> 7 (1999): 171–183). His abstract 
says [text in square brackets is mine]:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">I begin by elaborating a critical anarchist hermeneutic 
that understands interpretation as praxis and meaning(s) as mutable and 
unstable. I suggest that the film can be understood as an effort to mediate a 
crisis in human relations with technology (a potential &#39;other&#39;). I argue that 
the principal element or relation through which this crisis is posed and then 
resolved is that between Picard, Data and the Borg &#39;queen&#39;. [The hybridity of 
the Borg signifies a descent into disorder, and Disorder, as the absence of any 
organising principle of knowledge or experience, is further linked to the 
post-structuralist critique of &#39;foundationalism&#39; and the anarchist critique of 
government.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In his conclusion, he further says that the film suggests</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">[ . . . ] that &#39;the real&#39; must be preserved at all costs, 
and, if possible, through the continual redeployment of a single paradigmatic 
relationship. Ironically, this is <i>not</i> a father-son relation [Picard and 
Data], but that held to exist between man and woman [Picard/Data and the Borg 
queen], as elaborated in the Biblical account of the creation of the world. 
Technology, like Eve, is derivative of man, and should therefore serve man as an 
ally and a helpmate. In anarchist terms, this signifies the hegemony of a 
particular strand of Western philosophy that has been a dominant founding 
principle in the organisation of contemporary knowledge and experience. The 
critique of foundations and organising principles is <i>the</i> task of <i>our</i> 
times.</p>

<p class="aplaintext">A form of anarcho-capitalism plays a major role in many of these 
entertaining novels. In <i>Snow Crash</i>, territory is primarily controlled by corporate 
franchises, termed "Franchise-Operated Quasi-National Entities" such as "Mr 
Lee's Greater Hong Kong" and "Nova Sicilia," with privately-operated police 
and judicial systems, where the landscape has been turned into a patchwork 
quilt of franchise enclave communities, and the increasingly residual federal government is just one more competitor in a free market for sovereignty 
services.</p>

<p class="blockquote">It's always been a mystery [ . . . ], 
but then, that's how the government is. It was invented to do stuff that private 
enterprise doesn't bother with, which means that there's probably no reason for 
it; you never know what they're doing or why. (ch. 63)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Its sequel, <i>The Diamond Age</i>, depicts a 
more mature anarcho-capitalist society where Common Law and other international 
private law conventions have evolved into a Common Economic Protocol to which 
all non-outlaw phyles and FOQNEs subscribe in their own legal systems.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Baroque Cycle</i> is described 
by the <a href="http://www.leftbankbooks.com/sp.php#sf">Left Bank Books</a>

read.&quot; It also one of Mark Bould&#39;s selections in <i>

<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/book-review-seveneves-by-neal-stephenson/">
Zeke Teflon</a> as &quot;excellent&quot;, anarchist
<a href="https://www.popehat.com/2013/12/21/clarks-favorite-books-part-1-science-fiction/">
Clark</a> at Popehat has this to say:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">Anathem has it all: deep history, parallel worlds, 
medieval monasteries, formal logic, quantum uncertainty, cross-polar chase 
scenes, orbital mechanics, starships. A lot of people say that they thought that 
Anathem was too wordy or too weird. I feel bad for them – they&#39;ve admitted 
something very embarrassing about themselves in public.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s too weird, but it&#39;s definitely much 
too long, and plain <i>dull</i>: a worthy failure, I would say. I guess I&#39;ve now 
embarrassed myself in public.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Seveneves </i>is another doorstop of a book: the Moon 
is blown up in a cosmic collision, and most of humanity dies in the 5000 year 
pounding by lunar debris; a tiny colony survives in orbiting space habitats, and 
in the final third of the book it transpires that there have also been survivors 
on Earth, above and below the sea. </p>

<p class="aplaintext"><i>
Islands in the Net</i> was &quot;Influenced by Bob Black's <i>The Abolition of Wor</i>k.&quot; (Dan Clore) 
Black himself says &quot;In <i>Islands in the Net, </i>Sterling extrapolates from 
several anti-work stances: the &quot;avant-garde job enrichment&quot; [ . . . ] of the 
laid back Rhizome multinational; the selective post-punk high-tech of 
Singapore&#39;s Anti-Labour Party, and the post-agricultural <i>guerrilla</i> 
nomadism of Tuareg insurgents in Africa. He incorporates a few of my phrases 
verbatim.&quot; (Black 2015) <i>Islands </i>has been perceived as an anarchist/anti-capitalist utopia (mailing to anarchysf). 
Hakim Bey (Peter Lamborn Wilson), who describes himself as a Cyberpunk fan, 
makes particular reference to this novel, as &quot;based on the assumption that the 
decay of political systems will lead to a decentralized proliferation of 
experiments in living&quot; . . .</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">'Bicycle Repairman' 
takes place in an anarchist squatters' enclave.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Holy Fire</i> was strongly recommended by 
an anarchysf lister, describing it as &quot;germane to this list because of its 
treatment of the dynamics of a post-plague society, and social conservativism 
among the very long-lived.&quot; A couple of minor characters are anarchists.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In 'Distraction', early 21st 
century America is &quot;populated by large gangs of postmodern proletarian nomads.&quot; 
&quot;Sterling's vision is, in fact, profoundly anarchistic. [. . .] Distraction 
updates pre-modern gift exchange for the postmodern age, and thus charts a 
radically non-hierarchical vision of the near future.&quot; (Call, 2002)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In 2015 Sterling wrote the introduction to 
Bob Black&#39;s essay collection <i>Instead of Work.</i> While he says he &quot;never 
became a Bob Black disciple&quot;, &quot;Mostly I just admired and tried to emulate his 
conceptual freedom.&quot; (vi–vii)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Pirate Utopia</i> is a dieselpunk 
alternate history centred on the curious story of the Free State of Fiume, in 
the aftermath of World War I. Anarcho-syndicalists are among the players, but 
it&#39;s an eclectic mix, also featuring fascists and futurists, Howard, Houdini, 
and Lovecraft.<br>

Contributors are not quite clear what to make of the series: for one, &quot;SU has a 
lot of subtle anarchist stuff going on&quot;, but another says &quot;I&#39;m still trying to 
work out why the anarchists chose SU to be their advertising campaign. It&#39;s 
about peace and love on the planet Earth, not anarchy&quot;, which gets the rejoinder 
&quot;because anarchism is about peace and love on the planet Earth :)&quot;. One poster 
observes that S02E17, &#39;Sadie&#39;s Song,&#39; depicts a small image of an

<h3>Robert Louis Stevenson</span></h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Freedom</i> in 1889 quoted from one of Stevenson's Samoan letters, in which he speaks of a certain fascination for the anarchists and compares them with the early Christians. The anonymous writer concluded that 
&quot;Stevenson was a man of an intensely reactionary mind, but he had the honesty, when he saw Anarchists in a truer, clearer light, to say so, and we respect him for it.&quot; (anon. 1899)</span></p>

<h3>
George R. Stewart: <i>Earth Abides</i> (1949)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">
Most of the population dies from disease; the hero leads his tiny new tribe into 
post-history. <i>Earth Abides</i> was reviewed anonymously in <i>Anarchy</i> in 
1963, with a degree of reluctant respect: &quot;The author writes with a Defoe-like 
verisimilitude, and a fascinating wealth of ecological detail&quot;; though the 
survivors &quot;start life afresh from zero: no government, nothing in the way of 
constraints and restraints&quot;, the story &quot;does not end as anarchists would like it to end.&quot; 
This is clearly because after 21 years of Edenic anarchy the State is 
effectively re-established when the decision is taken to hang a stranger who 
drunkenly brags of his venereal diseases. Ish, the hero, reflects:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">
Yet there was an irony. The State—it should be a kind of nourishing mother, 
protecting the individuals in their weakness, permitting a fuller life. And now 
the first act of the State, its originating function, had been to bring death. 
Well, who could say? Likely enough, in the dim past reaches of time, the State 
had always sprung from the need to crystallize power in some troublous time, and 
primitive power must often have expressed itself in death. (pt II, c. 8)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
Despite this anarchist analysis, Ish falls for the old story that at least it&#39;s 
better than anarchy, &quot;when there was no strong force to protect the individual 
against whatever might rise up against him.&quot;</p>

&nbsp;</p>

<h3>S.L.S. (pseudonym of John St Loe Strachey): <i>The Great Bread Riots: or, What Came of Fair Trade </i>(1885)</span></h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Following the abolition of free trade, the rioting of the unemployed is led by anarchical secret societies, based on violence, their organisation copied from those of Germany and Russia; the events are recounted as from 1934. It is a very slight work, of negligible interest for anarchists.</p>

			<img border="0" src="covers/strangedays.jpg" width="32" height="44">
			<i>Strange Days</i> (1995, dir. Kathryn Bigelow)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Set in the last two days of the 20th century, the film 
follows the story of a dealer in illicit POV recordings of individuals&#39; complete 
sensory input as, while investigating the murder of a prostitute, he uncovers 
the truth of the cop shooting of a black leader. Rather heavy-handed and 
over-long, and the story-line—apart from the technological fillip—pretty 
conventional, not to say old-fashioned.</p>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140426223840/http:/www.tomjennings.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/RoseColoured.html">
Tom Jennings</a>, in 2006, took a much more positive view:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">[ . . . ] Kathryn Bigelow&#39;s magnificent <i>Strange Days</i> 
experiments viscerally with the phenomenology of simulation offered by new 
media, gradually expanding the significance of their alienating distraction for 
confused thrill-seekers out into the seething public sphere of a chaotic 
neo-noir 1999 LA under brutal martial law. The troubled pairing of ex-vice squad 
porn merchant Ralph Fiennes and streetwise action heroine Angela Bassett tangle 
with corrupt entrepreneurs and lowlives in a decadent cross-fertilising cultural 
milieu of hip-hop punk, blundering into a conspiracy to assassinate a Black 
revolutionary leader which threatens to tip the civic millennium festivities 
over the brink into grass-roots insurrection. Through an unprecedented synthesis 
of film and psychoanalytic theory, exploitation of cinema traditions and bravura 
design, editing and photography, it is far more nuanced than <i>Crash</i> in 
tackling the subjective and social significance of race, as well as of gender 
and class. The film also works hard to specify its historical contingency in the 
best traditions of science fiction as speculation on the present (for example by 
Stanislaw Lem, William Burroughs or Philip K. Dick)—rather than hysterical 
inflation into universal values, or the fashionably subversive adolescent hype 
which passes for philosophical resonance in [ . . . ] <i>V for Vendetta</i> (as 
in <i>The Matrix</i> series). <i>Strange Days</i> even excuses its major flaws 
(such as a deliberately implausible, if arguably utopian, central relationship) 
by managing to render its politically ultra-conservative resolution as dystopian 
recuperation—a final knowing flourish on the role of mass entertainment in 
taming desire in labyrinths of repressive desublimation.</p>

<a href="https://libcom.org/forums/theory/survivors-vs-anarchism-30112008">
&quot;survivors&quot; vs. anarchism?</a>. One contributor said he didn&#39;t think it likely 
that an anarchist society could arise in a catastrophic situation like 
near-extinction:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">libertarian communism will only come about with 
participation of a widespread social movement that creates the conditions 
through the actual praxis of that movement. With <i>Survivors </i>we have 
isolated scattered individuals coming together to form small groups where all 
social norms have been rendered obsolete, so any group that wishes to form on 
anarchist lines would need to arm themselves to defend against outside raiders 
etc, a situation which wouldn&#39;t be compatible with libertarian communism.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">For another, the remake was definitely inferior:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">The 70&#39;s series took time to develop about the problems of 
setting up a community: growing things, getting things, settlement being 
destroyed by food poisoning. It also didn&#39;t hold back on its punches, in one 
episode (law and order) the main characters—who we had been shown as trying to 
maintain their humanity—are shown as losing that humanity when they voted to 
execute a character with learning disabilities who they falsely believe to have 
raped and killed another character.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The same poster acknowledged, however, that the original 
show had been too white and middle class, and objected that &quot;the main 
ideological thrust is that there needs to be a leader.&quot;</p>

<p class="aplaintext">
Really a single long novel, the setting is 
chiefly a planet named Bakunin, orbiting the star Kropotkin; the principal city 
is called Godwin (with a street called Vanzetti), and the spaceport Proudhon.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">

a world called Bakunin that operates on anarcho-capitalist principles, and 
examines the particular problem of an anarcho-capitalist society defending 
itself against a statist aggressor when that aggressor hires so many of the 
Anarcho-capitalist society's own denizens as mercenary forces."&nbsp;
"Its portrayal of society on the planet Bakunin is 
arguably much more critical of the basic premise of anarchism than is typical of 
the genre, coming close to a libertarian dystopia." "While Swann's portrayal of 
anarchism falls far short of advocacy, it is clear in the text that his sympathy 
is with the anarchists and not with the state." [Wikipedia:

This really over-eggs the cake. 
Apart from the name-checks, there is little that can be described as anarchist 
about the planet Bakunin, apart from the absence of a world government. It&#39;s not 
really even markedly anarcho-capitalist or libertarian, although there&#39;s perhaps 
a degree of warmth to a woolly notion of anarchy.</p>

similarity to Godwin&#39;s thinking: the Houyhnhnm, commenting on British society, 
expressed the opinion &quot;That our institutions of government and law were plainly 
owing to our gross defects in reason, and by consequence, in virtue; because 
reason alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature . . .&quot; (Pt IV, c. VII). 
Godwin certainly admired Swift, whom he described as a man who &quot;appears to have 
had a more profound insight into the true principles of political justice than 
any preceding or contemporary author.&quot; (Godwin 1798) &quot;For the stern and 
inflexible integrity of his principles, and the profound sagacity of his 
speculation, he will be honoured by a distant posterity.&quot; (Godwin 1798: 443) Of <i>
Gulliver&#39;s Travels </i>itself Godwin wrote that &quot;It was unfortunate that a work 
of such inestimable wisdom failed at the period of its publication from the mere 
playfulness of its form, in communicating adequate instruction to mankind.&quot; 
Interestingly, Godwin&#39;s diaries record that he was reading
<i>Gulliver&#39;s Travels </i>while he was writing <i>Political Justice </i>in just 
the same way as his daughter&#39;s diary records that she was reading 
<i>Political Justice </i>while writing <i>Frankenstein </i>(Preu: 372). An 
extract from the Voyage to the Houyhnhnms was printed in 
<i>La Révolte</i> in 1893. Preu claims that if Godwin is the father of 
anarchism, Swift, through his influence on Godwin, is certainly its grandfather.

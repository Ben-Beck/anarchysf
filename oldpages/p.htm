Emile Pataud and Emile Pouget: <i>How We Shall Bring about the Revolution: Syndicalism and the Co-operative

second edition with preface by Peter Kropotkin 1911; original title
<i><a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k61660z">Comment nous ferons la R&eacute;volution</a></i>)</span></h3>

<p class="aplaintext">Plodding but worthy 
attempt at describing how the syndicalist revolution took place in a near-future 
France. The clunky English translation doesn't help.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Kropotkin advises that too much attention should not be given to the detail. 
Rather, what the book seeks to give is "the general idea of the revolution", to 
borrow Proudhon&#39;s phrase. Also, clearly, "it is not Anarchism that they picture 
for us." But:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="aplaintext">In this book of Pataud's and Pouget's can be felt [ . . . ] the life-giving breath of 
	Anarchism in their conceptions of the future, especially in the pages 
	devoted to Production and Exchange. And what they say on this subject should 
	be seriously considered by every worker who loves Freedom, Justice, and 
	Equality, as well as by everyone anxious to avoid the sanguinary struggles 
	of a coming Revolution. [Preface: xxxiv]</p>

<h3>Laurie Penny (2016) <i>Everything Belongs to the Future</i></h3>
<p class="aplaintext">The author describes the novella as &quot;a near-future 
quasi-dystopian anarchist fable about biotechnology, surveillance, state 
violence, love and time.&quot; [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SolarpunkAnarchists/?fref=ts">interview</a>] Activists (nowhere described as anarchists or 
anarcho-syndicalists, notwithstanding the advance publicity) steal anti-aging 
pills from gerontocrats to distribute them freely to the local dispossessed, but are betrayed by a 
police nark. Though described on the Facebook Solarpunk Anarchists page as an 
anarcha-feminist, Penny refers to herself as &quot;a pinko queer feminist social 
justice warrior&quot; (though on her Twitter feed in 2018 she does indeed 
describe herself as anarcha-feminist).</p>

<h3>Marge Piercy: <i>Dance the Eagle to Sleep </i> (1970); <i>Woman on the Edge of Time</i> (1976);
<i>He, She and It </i>aka<i> Body of Glass </i>(1991)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Dance the Eagle to Sleep</i> tells of an attempt by a 
group of student revolutionaries to set up a communistic alternative society 
within an oppressive near future USA. Very much of its period. It was deemed 
&quot;pretty good&quot; by a contributor to Anarchy 101&#39;s

<p class="aplaintext"><i>Woman on the Edge of

Alyx, in <i>Open Road</i>, call &quot;the future-anarchist village&quot; of Matapoisett. 
In the novel, Piercy herself doesn't use the term 'anarchist',
although there is indeed no government: the closest thing to it are the township and regional planning councils, which
are chosen by lot. However, in her

introduction</a> to the 2016 edition she says: &quot;Like most women’s utopias, the 
novel is profoundly anarchist and aimed at integrating people back into the 
natural world and eliminating power relationships.&quot; The book was enthusiastically reviewed in <i>Anarchist Feminist Magazine</i> in 1985.

<h3>John Pilgrim: &#39;<a href="https://archive.org/stream/AnarchyNo.34#page/n1/mode/2up">Science 
Fiction and anarchism</a>&#39; (1963)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">This pioneering article was first published by Pilgrim in 
issue 34 of <i>Anarchy</i> magazine, based on lectures he&#39;d given in 1960 (he&#39;d 
had an earlier article entitled &#39;Viewpoint: The Anarchism in Science Fiction&#39; 
published in <i>Freedom</i> in the year of his lectures). Leaving aside earlier 
works on utopian fiction, (and not counting anarchist reviews of individual 
works of sf, in which he&#39;d been preceded by Arthur W. Uloth and others), this 
seems to have been the first real treatment of anarchism and sf, written years 
before Moorcock&#39;s better known article (which itself was in part prompted by his 
memory of Pilgrim&#39;s take on the subject, which was clearly unfair to Pilgrim).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Pilgrim himself was a journalist, as well as playing 
washboard with the skiffle group The Vipers, who had a residency at the famous 
2i&#39;s coffee bar; and playing blues with Big Bill Broonzy, and Sonny Terry &amp; 
Brownie McGhee.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>H. Beam Piper: <i>Little Fuzzy</i> (1962)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Revolves around determining whether or not a small furry 
species discovered on an alien planet is sapient. In the words of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Fuzzy">Wikipedia</a>, it &quot;features 
a mild libertarianism that emphasizes sincerity and honesty.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>H. Beam Piper and John J. McGuire: <i>A Planet for Texans </i>(1958; a.k.a.
<i>Lone Star Planet</i>)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Won the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 
1999.</p>
<br>
<h3>Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In his writing, but not in his politics, Poe was much influenced by William Godwin. Godwin actually lived long enough for
one of his late works (<i>Lives of the Necromancers</i>) to be reviewed by Poe in the 
<i>Southern Literary Messenger </i>(December
1835). Poe was appreciated by the individualist Émile Armand, who instigated the publication of a French translation of
Poe's <i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket </i>(1838), and of a collection of his tales, at the turn of the 20th
century.</p>
<br>
<h3>Frederik Pohl: &#39;The Tunnel Under the World&#39; (1955); <i>The Years of the City</i> (1980)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Vittorio Curtoni called the 1955 story a &quot;great 
masterpiece&quot;, &quot;like a Kafkaesque nightmare transposed to our days.&quot; (Curtoni 
1978) <i><a href="biblio.htm#Bould">Red Planets</a></i> lists this story and 
&#39;The Midas Plague&#39; as &quot;Among the very best 1950s SF satires.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Years of the City </i>depicts New York in the 21<sup>st</sup> 
century. The political system is what is known as 'demarchy', a form of decentralized 
participatory democracy in which 
all government offices are filled by average citizens chosen using a form of 
selective service, with an overall goal of reducing bureaucracy and legislation.</p>
<br>
<h3>Frederik Pohl &amp; C.M. Kornbluth<i>:</i> <i>The Space Merchants</i> 
(1952); <i>Gladiator-at-Law</i> 
(1955</span>)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">One of the best-known of 1950s sf novels, the cynical dystopia of
<i>The Space Merchants</i> is a strong attack on advertising and consumerism; for the advertising company boss, 
&quot;&#39;Power ennobles. Absolute power ennobles absolutely&#39;&quot; (c. 4). For M. Eagle 
&quot;There can be few more biting (or amusing) satires of capitalism-gone-wild&quot;; and Vittorio Curtoni also found it 
&quot;a most enjoyable novel which dismantles and overturns [the] mechanisms of cosmic imperialism.&quot; (25)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Gladiator-at-Law</i> features big-business intrigue, in which a house-production monopoly is overthrown by a motley crew of the dispossessed. Pilgrim found it notable, and unusual in that the insurrection is successful. (Pilgrim 1963: 371)</p>

<br>

<h3>Jerry Pournelle and John F. Carr, eds:<i> The Survival of Freedom</i> (1981)</span></h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Very dated (Cold War) 
libertarian anthology of essays and sf short stories. Includes two short essays 
by the anarcho-capitalist David Friedman, including 'Why Anarchy?', with a 
lukewarm introductory note by Pournelle. It won the Libertarian Futurist Society 
Hall of Fame Award in 2001.</p>

&nbsp;<h3>Terry Pratchett: <i>Night Watch</i> (2002)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">A worthy winner of the 2003 Prometheus award, and included 
in LibraryThing&#39;s
<a href="http://www.librarything.com/tag/anarchism,+science+fiction">anarchism,

			brilliant realisation of the micro-dystopia that is The Village.</p>

			<p class="aplaintext">Reason.com has shown its approval of <i>The

			<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext">But the most extended libertarian critique is

			<a href="http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/libre/libre001.pdf">
			Different Values. An Analysis of Patrick McGoohan&#39;s <i>The Prisoner</i></a>, 
			first published in <i>New Libertarian Review</i> in 1974. For Tame

				&quot;The theme of <i>The Prisoner </i>was strikingly clear, then: the Man 
				versus the State, Autonomy and Individualism versus 
				Regimentation and Conformity, <b>the Individual versus the 
				Collective</b>.&quot; [Tane&#39;s emphasis]<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;<div style="left: 529.301px; top: 892.333px; font-size: 15px; font-family: serif; transform: scaleX(0.947904);">
				<p class="blockquote">McGoohan&#39;s basic theme throughout <i>The 
				Prisoner</i> was surely that responsibility for our lives and 
				our society resides within ourselves—within the self. In other 
				words, it is the &#39;sanction of the victim&#39; upon which the 
				despotism of State and Society ultimately rests. The individual 
				can resist and question authority and the dominant social 
				values, or he can, as most people in fact do, abdicate the 
				responsibility, abdicate autonomy and individuality, and succumb 
				to Society. It is within &#39;Number 1&#39;, one&#39;s self, that the 
				decision is made as to whether one is a &#39;prisoner&#39; of Society or 
				not. </div>
			<p class="aplaintext">For Tane, too, &quot;Technically, <i>The Prisoner
			</i>was brilliant, certainly the most imaginative and dazzling 
			television series ever executed.&quot;<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;<p class="aplaintext">
			He concluded: 
			
				&quot;The Prisoner will always remain an 
				inspiration to those involved in the struggle for individualism 
				and liberty, to those who will &quot;not be pushed, filed, indexed, 
				stamped, briefed, debriefed, or numbered&quot; and who wish to make 
				their life their own.&quot; 
			
				<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;<p class="aplaintext">The series won 
			a Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2002, so far the only TV series 
			ever to have achieved this distinction.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext">In 2017, fully 50 years since the series&#39; 
			first broadcast, it still seems reasonable that the entry in <i>
			<a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/prisoner_the">SFE</a></i> 
			should conclude that <i>The Prisoner</i> &quot;is in the opinion of 
			many—often those discontented with Space Opera—the finest sf 
			television series to date.&quot;</p>

<p class="aplaintext">Reviewed by Margaret Killjoy at
<a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/movies/the-purge-2013">The 
Anarcho-Geek Review</a>, who noted that &quot;the filmmakers actually took the themes 
of the movie in interesting directions,&quot; one theme being class war, though as a 
whole the film is essentially &quot;a liberal parable,&quot; indeed &quot;terribly liberal.&quot; 
Killjoy points out, too, that the focus on violent killing is unrealistic, as 
during a temporary suspension of law enforcement people are much more likely to 
indulge in looting than in revenge murder.</p>
<h3><img border="0" src="covers/thepurgeanarchy.jpg" width="32" height="44"> <i>

<p class="aplaintext">Sequel to <i>The Purge</i>. On Purge Night a mother and daughter, a young couple, and a purger bent 
on revenge join forces after finding themselves on the city streets, trying to

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The film received, reluctantly, a surprisingly positive
<a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/movies/the-purge-anarchy-2014">review</a> 
from D. Markotin, at the Anarcho-Geek Review. Finding it &quot;rather excellent&quot;, 
Markotin writes that &quot;<em>The Purge: Anarchy</em> hits on three themes quite 
dear to my heart: the evils of class society; the evils of government; and how 
revenge usually makes everything worse but that revolutionary violence is okay.&quot; 
&quot;Strangely, one of the themes of this film is that without government, we <em>
won&#39;t</em> just run around killing one another. Which I find to be a very 
defensible position. And it strikes a fascinating, and I would argue 
anarchistic, balance between pacifism and the glorification of violence.&quot; In 
conclusion, &quot;The movie is definitely not above critique. But I&#39;m incredibly 
impressed at how the film created an enjoyable, plot-driven action film (not 
really a horror film) out of a rather intense class war parable. And maybe I&#39;ll 
even forgive them for using the name anarchy in the title.&quot;</p>

<h3>Thomas Pynchon: <i>Gravity&#39;s Rainbow</i> (1973); <i>Against the Day</i> (2006)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Gravity&#39;s Rainbow</i> is long and difficult, with over 
400 characters and multiply fractured plots, and has been seen as 
quintessentially postmodern. Set principally in 1945, the centrality of rocketry 
and rocket engineering, coupled with reflection on determinism, paranoia and 
conspiracy, bring it within the purview of science fiction without ever really 
approaching the genre per se. Compelling, even when (as often) impenetrable. The 
interest for anarchists is less overt than in <i>Against the Day. </i>Both works 
were discussed in a session called &#39;Against the Day: anarchism in the fiction of 
Pynchon&#39; at the <a href="http://sfbay-anarchists.org/conference/bastard-2012/">
2012 BASTARD conference</a>.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Against the Day </i>is an exceptional, and exceptionally long, transgeneric novel 
steeped in science fictional influences, and heavily laced with anarchists and 
anarchist activities reflecting the period setting (1893 to just after World War 
I). There are, in particular, references to Tucker, Bakunin, Stirnerite 
individualism, the Haymarket martyrs, the IWW, Zapata, Villa and the Mexican 
revolution, and a number of assassinations: Czolgosz&#39;s of McKinley, Bresci&#39;s of 
Umberto I, Sipido&#39;s attempted assassination of the Prince of Wales, and 
Berkman&#39;s attempted murder of industrialist Henry Clay Frick.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Some of the novel&#39;s characters are themselves 
anarchists, sympathetically portrayed, as noted in Killjoy (2009 and 2011).

Thomas Pynchon and American Counterculture</a>,</i> has noted that &quot;As his 
literary career has progressed, the author&#39;s antipathy to capitalism has become 
ever more visible, as has his relative sympathy for anarchist solutions, which 
is fully confirmed by <i>Against the Day </i>(2006).&quot; The novel was reviewed by 
Michael Moorcock in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> in November 2006, the review 
being reprinted in Moorcock (2012: 278-280):</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote"><i>Against the Day</i> is a fine example of a successful 
marriage between the popular and the intellectual, between fiction and science. 
[ . . . ] Gloriously, demandingly, daringly, Pynchon has rediscovered vulgarity 
and continues to proved that the novel has never been more vibrant, more various 
or better able to represent our complex world.</p>

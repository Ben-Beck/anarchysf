<p class="aplaintext">In a 2008 interview Ursula Le Guin stated that she didn&#39;t consider herself an anarchist, because &quot;I 
entirely lack the activist element&quot;. But when asked if she minded that a lot of 
anarchists claimed her, in approximately the same way they claimed Tolstoy, her 
response was &quot;Of course I don&#39;t mind! I am touched and feel unworthy.&quot; 
(strangers, 2008; and republished in <a href="k.htm#Killjoy">Mythmakers &amp; 
Lawbreakers. Anarchist writers on fiction</a>) Asked, in 2011, if she would 
describe herself as an anarchist (politically), her reply was &quot;Politically, no; 
I vote, I&#39;m a Democrat. But I find pacificist anarchist thought fascinating, 
stimulating, endlessly fruitful.&quot; (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/reader/1604864036?_encoding=UTF8&query=lovely art#reader_1604864036">&#39;A 
Lovely Art&#39;</a>, p91) Jamie Heckert, writing in <i>Fifth Estate</i> in 
2010, reflected:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">In recent interviews, you suggested that perhaps you don&#39;t 
qualify for the label anarchist because you are middle-class or because what you 
do isn&#39;t activism. I invite you to reconsider. Who needs activism when you have
<i>wu wei</i>? And why not be a middle-class anarchist? This is no contradiction 
in my book—and your own books have never shied away from life&#39;s apparent 
contradictions. They are embraced, queered.</p>
<p class="blockquote">. . . Whether or not you call yourself an anarchist, 
you&#39;ve helped me to deepen my own understanding of what an anarchist can be, can 
do. Of what I can do. Of who I can become. [<a href="http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jamie-heckert-queerly-erotic-an-open-love-letter-to-ursula-le-guin">online</a>]</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Reviewing Le Guin&#39;s science fictional oeuvre 
as a whole, Max Haiven&#39;s exceptionally perceptive 2015
<a href="biblio.htm#Haiven">essay</a> on Le Guin concludes that it exemplifies 
prefigurative fiction, which &quot;invites us to both imagine, cultivate and critique 
the dynamic tension between authority and responsibility as it exists in our own 
hearts, our communities, our struggles and our movements.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Rocannon&#39;s World</i> is among the works 
discussed by Haiven; he find that it &quot;demonstrates many anarchistic themes&quot;, 
among which he includes critical anthropology and a humanism of possibility. </p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">For George Woodcock <i>The Left Hand of 
Darkness</i> was Le Guin&#39;s &quot;strangest and most successful novel&quot;. (Woodcock 
1976)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">For Oshee Eagleheart in 2010 &#39;Vaster 
than Empires and More Slow&#39; &quot;accurately and hilariously portrays the 
interactions within groups of &#39;crazy&#39; characters who dare to explore the far 
reaches of the social universe in search of workable ways of living.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Dispossessed 
</i>concerns two worlds, one moon to the other, with vastly differing political 
systems. One of these is &#39;Odonianism&#39;, a form of Taoist anarchist communism. For Le Guin, anarchism 
&quot;is the most idealist, and to me the most
interesting, of all political theories.&quot; (Le Guin, &#39;Introduction&#39; to
<i>The Wind&#39;s Twelve Quarters </i>(1975)). She was well-versed in
the historical anarchist tradition (especially Kropotkin, the Goodman brothers, and Bookchin), and this shows. The utopia itself is
&#39;ambiguous&#39; because flawed and mutable. The novel succeeds in presenting the most believable, and perhaps the best,
exploration of anarchism in a science fiction context, of any yet written. For 
John P. Clark, &quot;what is most notable about the work is the protagonist&#39;s 
ruthlessly anarchistic critique of Annares itself. It is, in effect, an 
anarchist critique of anarchism and a utopian critique of the dangers of 
utopia.&quot; (Clark 2009: 22) Uri Gordon describes it as &quot;perhaps the most honest 
attempt at portraying a functioning anarchist society&quot;. (Gordon 2009: 267) The 
novel won the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1993. For Paul 
J. Comeau, in 2010, &quot;The novel is one of the best, if not the best, fictional 
realization of an anarchist society as it might be practiced, and remains one of 
the most influential modern utopian novels written.&quot; In 
the 2010 online <a href="http://www.anarchistsurvey.com/results/">Anarchist 
Survey</a>, when asked &quot;What is your favourite anarchist book?&quot;, of single books
<i>The Dispossessed </i>received the third highest number of hits, only 
surpassed by two works by Peter Kropotkin. The anonymous reviewer in <i>
<a href="http://www.afed.org.uk/org/org81.pdf">Organise!</a></i> magazine in 
2013 
concluded that</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">Like the anarchist ideals the book so 
deftly explores, the story itself does 
not leave us with an ending so much 
as a staging point for our own journey. To use the ideas of the books, it
comes to you like a beggar man, relying on you for all that it requires and leaving you enriched by realising you 
would be better with nothing but 
what you carry as long as all needs 
are met. By the end of reading it I 
was stood at the wall between two 
worlds with the choice over whether 
I help to dismantle it, and by choosing to do so build a greater whole.<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The influence of this novel hasn&#39;t always been welcomed: Ken Macleod said of it, 
in his 2002
<a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/f0c74f_a5e27cce5f504aaea74c0c7f38946ff6.pdf">
article</a> on &#39;Anarchism and Science Fiction&#39;, that it &quot;has probably put more 
people off Anarchism than any other.&quot; Bob Black concurs with Michael 
Moorcock&#39;s view that the book is &quot;dull and journalistic&quot; (Black 2015). He 
continues: &quot;There is little indication that Le Guin is very familiar with anarchist or 
utopian literature. Contrary to legend, Le Guin is no anarchist. If she is, then 
where has she been, politically [ . . . ] for the last forty years? Writing 
stories and making money.&quot; Noting that in 2015 she wrote an introduction to a 
collection of some of Bookchin&#39;s old essays (<i>The Next Revolution</i>)<i>,</i> he finds further cause in this for 
attacking her:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">Le Guin now claims that Bookchin&#39;s &quot;Post-Scarcity 
Anarchism&quot; inspired <i>The Dispossessed</i>. That&#39;s ridiculous, since her 
&quot;ambiguous utopia&quot; Anarres is scarcity anarchism, not post-scarcity anarchism, 
and even its anarchism is compromised. If Bookchin inspired Le Guin, her 
inspiration was based on a misunderstanding. Taking her at her own word, she 
concealed her debt to Bookchin (and undoubtedly concealed it from Bookchin 
himself) until long after she had collected her Hugo and Nebula awards [ . . . 
]. (Black 2015: 227–228)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">According 
to Neil Easterbrook (p588) both <i>The Dispossessed</i> and <i>The Left Hand of 
Darkness</i> were frequently cited by Occupy Wall Street organizers and 
websites and, with Le Guin&#39;s approval, some marchers at Occupy Oakland carried placards depicting the 
cover of <i>The Dispossessed. </i>(<a href="http://www.themillions.com/2013/01/getting-away-with-murder-the-millions-interviews-ursula-k-le-guin.html">The

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&#39;The Day before the Revolution&#39; tells of Laia Odo herself, the founder of Odonianism. Odo is also one of &#39;The Ones Who
Walk away from Omelas&#39;, refusing to benefit from a system in which some gain at the expense of another. 
Andy Sunfrog, in 2010, concluded: &quot;Thinking of Laia Odo and Ursula K. Le Guin in 
our day, at the dawn of yet another decade, the day after many past revolutions 
and the day before many future ones, let&#39;s be like the anarchists of these 
stories, always seeking and questioning, never owning much more than our ideals 
and practicing them the day before, the day after, and most of all, today.&quot;

Margaret Killjoy</a> it is &quot;exactly the kind of story that can change the 
world.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Josh Gosicak, writing in<i> Fifth Estate</i> 
in<i> </i>2010, reflected on <i>The Lathe of Heaven</i> as a prescient 
&quot;post-neoliberal parable&quot;, a &quot;potent and unforgiving critique&quot; of both 
liberalism and neoliberalism. 
<a href="http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/lewis-call-postmodern-anarchism-in-the-novels-of-ursula-k-le-guin">
Lewis Call</a>, in 2007, saw the novel as &quot;creating the possibility of an <i>
ontological anarchy&quot;</i> and &quot;a major contribution to postmodern anarchism&quot;, 
creating &quot;the possibility of an anarchism that will be highly spiritual, deeply 
personal and yet also intimately engaged with the world.&quot; For Jesse Cohn 
this &quot;technocratic nightmare&quot; is &quot;an authentically anarchist anti-utopia&quot; (p. 
158). This work had also 
been sympathetically treated by 
George Woodcock in 1976.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">For Eagleheart, in the same issue of <i>
Fifth Estate</i>, &quot;<i>The Word for World is Forest</i> articulated the 
indigenous worldview of the interdependence of humans and &quot;nature&quot; in a way that 
I could immediately grok.&quot; [<i>Fifth Estate</i> #382 was a special issue, &quot;a 
Tribute to the Radical Imagination of Ursula K. Le Guin&quot;, in honour of her 80th 
birthday.]</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Eye of the Heron</i> concerns &quot;a 
society of pacifists inspired by the life and writings of Gandhi.&quot; (Comeau)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Compass Rose</i> was favourably 
reviewed in <i>Freedom </i>(Murtagh 183). Of the included story &#39;The New 
Atlantis&#39; the <i>Open Road</i> writers wrote that Le Guin&#39;s character &quot;knows his Bookchin&quot;. (Lessa, Takver &amp; Alyx 1978)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In <i>Always Coming Home </i>the Kesh, a 
far-flung future people, are, in their absence of formal hierarchy, 
&quot;fundamentally anarchistic&quot;; &quot;LeGuin offers a significant challenge to the 
outrageous (yet all too common) claim that capitalism represents the unalterable 
destiny of humanity&quot; (Call, 2002). Contrasted with the aggressive Condor people 
who live in the mountains, the two peoples &quot;present vividly aspects of how the 
world is and how it could be.&quot; (Peter Marshall, 1992/2008). Admirable as Le Guin 
generally was, this work—heavily influenced by romantic views of Native 
American culture—comes across as earnest but perhaps a little self-indulgent. She herself 
described it in 2010 as &quot;more deeply anarchist than <i>The Dispossessed</i>. [ . 
. . ] it&#39;s more subversive than the other one.&quot; [<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/9010456">Le 
Guin</a>] Eagleheart found <i>Always Coming Home </i>&quot;still the most complete 
and believable vision I&#39;ve found of a practical, possible, sustainable culture.&quot; For John P. Clark this work is Le Guin&#39;s &quot;masterpiece and, indeed, 
what is perhaps the masterpiece of utopian literature to date&quot;; he had earlier 
(2006) gone even further, calling it &quot;the greatest work of utopian fiction ever 
written.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">For the anonymous author of &#39;<a href="http://www.afed.org.uk/org/org81.pdf">Beyond 
Perfection</a>&#39;, &#39;Solitude&#39; is &quot;a strange, sad, beautiful story that 
consistently challenges gut responses and judgements on the nature of power and 
community. I highly recommend giving it a read, not as a model for an anarchist 
society but as a challenge to some of our ideas on interpersonal relationships 
and social duty.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Telling</i> is Le Guin&#39;s first 
Hainish novel after <i>The Dispossessed.</i> It is a further presentation of her 
anti-authoritarian and anti-fundamentalist views, not explicitly anarchist, but 
more credible than <i>Always Coming Home</i>, perhaps not least by drawing on 
her lead character&#39;s Terran upbringing.

challenge us to think and rethink resistance, gender, relationships, ideas and,

<h3>Madeleine L&#39;Engle: <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> (1962)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">SF for children, but now reads as rather dated, and 
over-religious.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Warmly remembered by a contributor to the Facebook 
Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum, who quotes a
<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/66705/how-wrinkle-time-changed-sci-fi-forever">
web article</a> on the book as saying &quot;&quot;There’s a political, anti-conformist 
message, and at its heart is the importance of family, community, freedom of 
choice, and, most of all, love.&quot;</p>

<h3>&#39;Lessa, Takver and Alyx&#39;: &#39;Daily Life in Revolutionary Utopia: Feminism, 
Anarchism &amp; Science Fiction&#39; (1978)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">A notable centre-page spread in the Canadian anarchist 
paper <i>Open Road. </i>The unidentified pseudonymous author(s) look(s) at the 
expected works by Le Guin, Piercy, and Russ, but also Brunner, Callenbach, 
Garskof, Reynolds, and Wittig. Available on the Internet at

<h3>Doris Lessing: <i>The Memoirs of a Survivor</i> (1974); <i>Shikasta</i> 
(1979)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In <i>Memoirs, </i>an observer watches passively the collapse around her of 
urban life and the reversion to tribalism. Though there are occasional 
suggestions that the community is becoming anarchistic rather than merely 
anarchic, the dominant tendency is towards primitive patriarchy.</p>

reading list</a>.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ira Levin: <i>This Perfect Day</i> (1970)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">A classic and very readable 
dystopia, in which the protagonist rebels against a future totalitarian world. 
Somewhat reminiscent of <i>The Prisoner</i>. Winner of the Libertarian Futurist 
Society Hall of Fame Award in 1992. Jeff
<a href="http://mises.org/daily/4866/Ira-Levin-and-This-Perfect-Day">Riggenbach</a> 
regards it as &quot;one of the top half-dozen libertarian novels ever published in 
our language.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>C.S. Lewis: <i>Out of the Silent Planet </i> (1938);<i> That Hideous Strength</i> (1945)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Out of the Silent Planet</i> is the first part in 
Lewis&#39;s theological space trilogy. For
<a href="http://thelibertarianliquidationist.com/2014/06/10/anarchy-by-c-s-lewis-pt-2/">
Justin Fowler</a> there are &quot;hints of a subtle anarchist philosophy threaded 
throughout&quot;, and the novel is &quot;a simply delicious work of literature that 
libertarians may treasure forever.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>That Hideous Strength </i>is the final 
part. It is included

<h3>Sinclair Lewis: <i>Arrowsmith</i> (1925); <i>It Can&#39;t Happen Here</i> (1935)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Paul Goodman drew attention to <i>Arrowsmith </i>in his 
1971 <i>New Reformation</i>, but found the idealised figure of the dedicated 
scientific researcher &quot;no longer believable&quot;. The book is almost fanatically 
pro-science, and its uncritical attitude to vivisection is alienating.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Ethel Mannin refers to <i>It Can&#39;t Happen 
Here</i> as &quot;excellent&quot;, and &quot;proving that it can&quot; [i.e. Fascism]. (Mannin 
1938:31) It tells of the rise of a home-grown fascist dictatorship in the USA, 
from the viewpoint of a New England liberal. There are a number of references to 
anarchists and anarchism, and the protagonist had earlier established his 
dissident credentials by questioning the guilt of Sacco and Vanzetti. Though 
dated, the book is still quite powerful, and is strong on libertarian New 
England values.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The novel tied for the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award 
in 2007.</p>

<h3>Brad 
Linaweaver:
<i>Moon of Ice </i>(1988)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Alternate history in 
which Germany won World War II, and a daughter of Joseph Goebbels, Hitler&#39;s 
propaganda minister, has become a renowned revolutionary anarchist. Hilda 
Goebbels likens her own disillusionment with Germany with Emma Goldman&#39;s <i>
Disillusionment with Russia</i>. Well-written, but the story-line is 
disappointing. The author is prone to suggesting that as an anarchist Goebbels 
should share his romantic view of the American dream.</p>

Anarquía. An Alternate History of the Spanish Civil War</i> (2004)  
	<img border="0" src="../anarchy_symbol.GIF" width="23" height="21"></h3>
<p class="aplaintext">This is something 
genuinely new, and without real precedent that I know of. The premise is that, 
instead of being squeezed out of the equation, the Spanish anarchists prevail, 
thanks to an alternate Wernher von Braun, who—with Hedy Lamarr—designs a 
rocket-based weapon which he puts in their hands. Prominent in the novel, too, 
are George Orwell, Ernest Hemingway, Konrad Zuse, and an imaginary pulp science 
fiction writer. The book is so well-researched, and the mise-en-scène so 
comparatively unfamiliar, that it is easy to suspend disbelief, in uncertainty 
as to what relates to our history and what to the alternate history 
presented.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">In the 
course of the narrative there is much discussion of the various flavours of 
anarchism active in Spain of the 1930s, not to mention the agorism that hadn&#39;t 
yet been invented in our history.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">The book 
ends all too quickly—almost before it&#39;s really got going—but there is a 
suggestion of a sequel in the offing, which is definitely something to look 
forward to.</p>

<h3>Jack London: <i>
<a href="http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/IronHeel/toc.html">The Iron Heel</a></i> (1907); 
&#39;The Enemy of All the World&#39; (1908)&#160;</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">London had knowledge of the anarchist movement of his time, writing sympathetically here of the Haymarket martyrs
(&quot;ferocious and wanton judicial murder&quot;—Penguin edn: 163), greatly admiring Louise Michel, and encountering Emma
Goldman in person in 1897 and 1909. Goldman wrote that &quot;As the artist he did not fail to see the beauties of anarchism,
even if he did insist that society would have to pass through socialism before reaching the higher stage of anarchism.&quot;
(Goldman 1931: 468) He was asked to write a preface for Alexander Berkman&#39;s
<i>Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist</i>, which he
did, though it was then refused, as he had taken the opportunity to propound the superiority of his own views over
those of the anarchists. According to Goldman,</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">His argument was summarized in his dictum: &quot;The man who 
can&#39;t shoot straight can&#39;t think straight.&quot; Evidently Jack assumed that the 
world&#39;s best thinkers were also the best shots. (506)</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Iron Heel</i> is written as a contemporary account of the abortive coming revolution and the oligarchy that suppresses it, with a commentary by a supposed historian 700 years hence, written after the triumph of socialism. It has attracted and irritated anarchist critics in roughly equal measure. Vign&eacute; d&#39;Octon, in 1922, for example, wrote that 
&quot;There are, one could say, pages of Jack London which could have been signed by Kropotkin, others which evoke the generous spirit, ardent and clairvoyant at the same time, of Reclus, of Bakunin, of Proudhon, of all those who, disgusted and indignant at the cruelties of capitalist and bourgeois society, engaged in the implacable struggle against the bosses and gods which are its incarnation. It was worth being read and re-read.&quot; (Vign&eacute; d&#39;Octon 1922 II:57). That said, 
&quot;Certainly, The Iron Heel is a fine and powerful book, worthy in all respects of Jack London, but I prefer his others.&quot; (Vign&eacute; d&#39;Octon 1924: 63) 
Other anarchist critics, including Jack Robinson and S.E. Parker, were 
dismissive of the view that London had foreseen the rise of fascism, and 
condemned him for his racism and leader-worship.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&#39;The Enemy of All the World&#39; is a trivial 
revenge against the world story, featuring a violent anarchist—though London 
acknowledges that &quot;Perhaps the word is misused, and he is better described as a 
nihilist or an annihilist.&quot;</p>

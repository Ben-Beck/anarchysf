<h3>Nicholas P. Oakley:<i> The Watcher </i>(2013)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><em>&quot;The Watcher</em>, set in the anarchist Confederation 
universe, examines issues raised by ‘primitivist’ or green anarchist theory by 
considering the ethical and sociological implications of a culture that rejects 
technology but tries to remain free.&quot; (<a href="http://quercusrubra.co.uk/2014/01/14/the-watcher/">author&#39;s

<h3>John October (pseudonym of Christopher Portway): <i>The Anarchy Pedlars</i> (1976)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Despite the title, has nothing to do with anarchism.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nnedi Okorafor: <i>Who Fears Death </i>(2010)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">More fantasy than SF, but included in
<a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/okorafor_nnedi">SFE</a>, so 
accepted here. School of Octavia Butler. Included on the

<h3>Malka Older: <i>Infomocracy</i> (2016)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Debut novel with a promising premise of potential 
interest: in an internet-dominated world, nation states have fragmented, and the 
primary political units are now the &#39;centenals&#39;, micro-states with a population 
of just 100,000-odd. Teflon&#39;s
<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2016/07/02/review-infomocracy-by-malka-older/">
See Sharp Press review</a> is spot on in identifying the book&#39;s strengths and 
weaknesses, of which the latter outweigh the former. Given the premise, the 
dearth of information on how the centenals operate, internally, or how the 
system came about, or the political differences between the various factions 
fighting a global election, is significant. For Teflon the promise—despite the 
quality of the writing in other respects—remains unfulfilled.</p>

<p class="aplaintext">A Martian (but here called &#39;Marsian&#39; or &#39;Marsite&#39;) 
traveller to earth is encouraged to describe at length the utopian society of 
his native planet. Explicitly influenced by Herbert Spencer, the novel projects 
a surprisingly open and free society, with no government and no organised 
religion, and equal rights for men, women and children, but with a strong sense 
of order and self-regulation. Though the word is never used by Olerich, it is 
explicitly treated as an anarchist sf utopia by Brigitte Koenig in her essay in 
Davis and Kinna&#39;s <i>Anarchism and Utopianism, </i>included in Nettlau&#39;s &#39;<a href="biblio.htm#Nettlau">Utopies 
libertaires</a>&#39;, and referred to in Cohn&#39;s <i>
Underground Passages.</i> It&#39;s also noted by Bob Black for Olerich&#39;s advocacy of 
a 2-hour working day [Black 2015: 223].</p>

notes that &quot;The finger is pointed more at militarism and statism as being 
responsible for environmental devastation more than some kind innate 
species-wide propensity towards wrecking the Earth.&quot; Though finding the film 
&quot;excessively preachy and unsubtle&quot;, he concludes that &quot;Origin succeeds in coming 
close to what&#39;s called the social ecology school of environmental thought, 
emphasising human-nature cooperation and balance between the two as a solution 
to conflict, rather than one dominating or destroying the other.&quot;</p>

		<h3>
<a name="Orwell"></a>George Orwell: <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> (1949) <img border="0" src="../anarchy_symbol.GIF" width="23" height="21"></h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Orwell had considerable knowledge of anarchism and anarchists, most notably from his period as a combatant in the
Spanish Civil War, described in his <i>Homage to Catalonia </i>(1938 and 1953), where the anarchists are described very favourably.
Though after 1939 he distanced himself from anarchist views (disagreeing with 
their wartime pacifism), he became a good friend to anarchists. During and after
the Second World War he came into personal contact with the anarchist movement in Britain, mixing with them at
Freedom Bookshop and in pubs, and developing friendships with well-known British anarchists of the day, 
including Herbert Read, George Woodcock, and Vernon Richards; 
in 1946 he was billed to speak to the London Anarchist Group on Russian foreign 
policy (though it&#39;s not certain the talk took place); he
contributed a book review to <i>Freedom</i>, and in 1949 donated a typewriter to Freedom Press, also giving financial support
to <i>NOW, </i>Woodcock's anarchist publication. That year, while Orwell was 
treated in a sanatorium in Gloucestershire, his adoptive son Richard was lodged 
at the nearby Tolstoyan anarchist Whiteway Colony, where he attended school. (Bowker: 
403) It was said that &quot;At most, George Orwell may be said to have been an 
anarchist fellow-traveller; but he was one of the best there ever was.&quot; (Walter 
2011: 211 [Walter 2011 is the key reference for Orwell and Anarchism]; Goodway: 346-7) In an unexpected tribute, Class War&#39;s 
Ian Bone has written that &quot;Orwell&#39;s kind of pipe-smoking English radicalism was 
a greater influence than Bakunin or Kropotkin.&quot; (Bone) (See also
<a href="biblio.htm#Laursen">Laursen</a> for a recent work of particular 
interest.)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext"><i>Nineteen Eighty-Four </i>has been seen by some anarchists as a vindication of Bakunin's opposition to the Marxist view of
the state (Woodcock 1966: 49). Like most people, anarchists have seen the novel as a masterpiece (Woodcock 1953: 150,
P.S. 1983). For Herbert Read it was &quot;the most terrifying warning that a man has ever uttered&quot; (Read 1950: 105). For
Woodcock &quot;what gives <i>1984</i> its peculiar force is the way in which it accepts Zamiatin's hints of the continuity between
the present and the possible Utopian future, and shows that these may be not merely signs of direction, but actual parts
of a new social structure even now forming around us.&quot; (Woodcock 1956: 97) Anarchist writing as the year itself
approached and passed noted how accurate some of Orwell's prognosis had been, especially how Britain had indeed
become no more than Airstrip One, an eastern outpost of the American Empire (PS 1983, Albon 1984). 
&quot;The most
important insight of <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>, which he shared with the anarchists, that the urge to power is more durable
and more dangerous than all ideologies, has been abundantly borne out with the decay of ideology in Russia and the
increase in the number of regimes in the modern world that depend wholly on naked power.&quot; (Woodcock 1984: 20) 
The anarchist activist Albert Meltzer, who admittedly only met Orwell once, was 
less impressed with his writings: &quot;To be honest, I thought Orwell a lot wittier 
than his writings, which I found usually, and at that time always, a dreadful 
bore. Such an opinion became literary heresy.&quot; (<a href="http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/meltzer/sp001591/angels22.html">Meltzer</a> 
1996)</p>

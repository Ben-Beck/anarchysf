'J.G. Eccarius': <i>We Should Have Killed the King </i>(1990)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">
Interesting and readable, 
but mostly non-sf, bracketed by a chapter set during the Peasants' Revolt and a 
chapter in a future where all but an anarchist community have died through 
ecological meltdown. Briefly reviewed in July 1990, in the <i>New Anarchist 
Review </i>#16<i>.</i></p>

against rogue AIs which ended only when the enemy escaped to the stars, taking 
with them millions of forcibly uploaded human minds. Earth is a deadly

survivors of the Fall exist in colonies scattered throughout the system, where 
they have created new economies based on nanotechnology and new societies 
ranging from corporate semi-democracies to anarchist cooperatives and 
libertarian associations.&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="aplaintext"><font face="Verdana" color="#0080FF">In October 2017
<a href="https://freedomnews.org.uk/interview-eclipse-phase-the-anarchist-rpg/">
<font face="Verdana">Freedom</font></a><font color="#0080FF"> published a long and interesting interview with Rob Boyle, co-creator of the game, in 
anticipation of the launch of its second edition. Boyle explicitly acknowledges 
his anarchist background and influences:</font></font></p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote"><font face="Verdana" color="#0080FF">I first identified as an anarcho-communist back 
in high school in the 1980s, and through the ’90s and beyond I was heavily 
involved with anarchist publishing and organising projects. EP co-creator Brian 
Cross also identifies as an anarchist, and he has a background as a sociology 
professor. We obviously injected a lot of our outlook.</font></p>
<p class="blockquote"><font face="Verdana" color="#0080FF">If I had to highlight my specific influences I 
would say Murray Bookchin, for his approaches towards confederalism, technology, 
and social ecology, and probably the entire German autonomist/antifa movement, 
for its non-dogmatic approach to synthesising radical ideas. Anarchist science 
writer Brian Martin probably impacted some of my views on scientific 
responsibility.</font></p>
<p class="blockquote"><font face="Verdana" color="#0080FF">Overall, politically, I think my ideas have been 
strongly shaped by the Sojourner Truth Organisation, active in the ’70s-80s, who 
have had a larger impact than I think most modern anarchists realise.</font></p>

<p class="aplaintext"><font face="Verdana" color="#0080FF">Asked about the forthcoming second edition, Boyle says 
that &quot;We have received some criticism that our depiction of autonomist space is 
sometimes “too utopian,” so in the future we’ll be focusing a bit more on some 
of the problems that might arise within a transhuman anarchist society, which is 
I think a good exercise for us as radicals.&quot;</font></p>

<h3>Greg Egan: <i>Permutation City </i> (1994); <i>Distress</i> (1995)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext"><i>Permutation City</i> is 
among books cited by Nick Mamatas in <i>The BASTARD Chronicles 2015</i> as hard 
sf overwhelmed by religious allegory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext"><i>Distress</i> is largely 
set against the backdrop of the sympathetically presented anarcho-syndicalist society 
of Stateless, an engineered coral island in the Pacific. The inhabitants mostly
disregard anarchist thinkers like Bakunin, Proudhon and Godwin; children are 
educated in sociobiology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">. . . 
Stateless seemed to run on the principle of people agreeing to do the same thing 
for entirely different reasons. It was a sum over mutually contradictory 
topologies which left the calculus of pre-space for dead; no imposed politics, 
philosophy, religion, no idiot cheer-squad worship of flags or symbols—but 
order emerged nevertheless. (ch. 24)</p>
<h3>T. Mullett Ellis: <i>Zalma</i> (1895)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Primarily a romantic fiction centred on an 
anarchist-hunter and an anarchist, the latter ultimately plotting to destroy 
society by means of anthrax germs distributed by balloon; she only succeeds in 
killing herself. Although the author displays considerable knowledge of 1890s 
anarchism, the image he paints of anarchists is only lurid and melodramatic: one 
instance will suffice, in which an anarchist, who has been betraying the 
conspiracy unwittingly via his wife, redeems himself by slitting her throat and 
writing &#39;Vive l&#39;Anarchie&#39; on the wall in her blood. (Tower edn: 167)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson: <i>Transmetropolitan </i>series 
(1997–2002)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Comic book series, noted by Evan Lampe on the Facebook 
Anarchists and Science Fiction page; Lampe has also published an essay on the 
series, included <a href="–">here</a>. The series is also recommended by two 
contributors to Reddit&#39;s
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1d7esn/">Anarchism</a> 
strand.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Harlan Ellison</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">. . . &quot;writes many short stories whose heroes have no 
truck with authority of any sort, though the conventions of the genre sometimes 
get in the way of the essential messages of his stories.&quot; (Moorcock 1978)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Ellison is fond of Thoreau, and quotes him 
repeatedly—for example in &#39;Silent in Gehenna&#39; (1971), and &#39;&quot;Repent, Harlequin!&quot;, 
said the Ticktockman&#39; (1965). The latter story is a classic of individual 
rebellion, near-anarchist in motivation; in 2015 it won the Prometheus Hall of 
Fame Award.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">Recommended by Melanie Petrewski, who says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">
It's kind of a different 
take, postulating a "floating republic" kind of syndicalist gathering based on 
17<sup>th</sup> century ships articles. &nbsp;I found it interesting because it seemed vaguely 
plausible as well as the fact that it completely avoided the sort of 
philosophical overthink in most Anarchist depictions.</p>
<h3><img border="0" src="covers/elysium.jpg" width="40" height="54"> <i>Elysium</i> 
(2013, dir. Neill Blomkamp)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In the 22nd century, Earth is overpopulated and has in 
effect been written off by the rich, who have decamped to an idyllic orbiting 
habitat; it becomes clear that by a reboot of the system immigration controls 
can be overridden, giving citizenship of Elysium to all inhabitants of Earth.</p>

Escape from L.A.</i> (1996, dir. John Carpenter)</h2>
<p class="aplaintext">A near future Los Angeles has been separated from the 
mainland by an earthquake, and is now being used as an internment camp and 
general people dump for anyone in the US deemed morally unfit. A criminal is 
tasked with a race against time, to retrieve a superweapon and the President&#39;s 
runaway daughter. Vaguely comedic, but mostly just silly.</p>

			<p class="aplaintext">The CEO of an Internet giant calls one of his

			asked to appraise the level of consciousness of his most recent 
			android construct, whom its creator already believes to have passed 
			the Turing test. The experiment proves all too successful, the

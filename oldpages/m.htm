article</a> on &#39;Anarchism and Science Fiction&#39; he notes that, after being 
introduced to anarchism in his youth, </p>&nbsp;<p class="blockquote">. . . off 
I went and read all I could find about Anarchism, starting with Giovanni 
Baldelli’s <i>Social Anarchism</i>, April Carter’s <i>The Political Theory of 
Anarchism</i>, and the Cohn-Bendits’ <i>Obsolete Communism</i>. They didn’t make 
me an Anarchist, but they changed my life. By way of retaliation, I’d like to 
get more Anarchists interested in science fiction, and change theirs. </p>
<p class="blockquote">What I’d like to see is not just more SF informed by 
Anarchism, but an Anarchist movement and climate of opinion much more informed 
by SF than it currently is. </p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">In the same article he stated that he 
couldn&#39;t have written <i>The Star Fraction</i> without Nozack&#39;s <i>Anarchy, 
State and Utopia</i>, or <i>The Sky Road</i> without Gambone&#39;s <i>Proudhon and 
Anarchism. </i><a href="http://libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/persp/persp010.pdf">
Elsewhere</a> he said that <i>Star Fraction</i> also owed a debt to Rothbard&#39;s
<i>For a New Liberty</i>, and <i>Stone Canal</i> to Friedman&#39;s <i>The Machinery 
of Freedom</i>.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Farah Mendlesohn&#39;s &#39;Impermanent 
Revolution: The Anarchic Utopias of Ken MacLeod&#39;, in her <i>
<a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/696324">Rejected Essays and 
Buried Thoughts</a>,</i> considers Macleod&#39;s &#39;Fall Revolution&#39; series (the first 
four novels above) at some length. She argues that &quot;Each of MacLeod’s utopias is 
built upon a different anarchist theory.&quot; In summary:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">The Fall Revolution Quartet tries to show how a viable 
anarchy might function, but unlike many utopian authors MacLeod is anxious to 
provide a choice of models: this multiplicity of models is in itself crucial to 
any anarchist project. To insist on only one model, only one truth for utopia, 
would be to revert to ideological authoritarianism. MacLeod outlines for us four 
potential or actual utopias: a Trotskyite utopia (which never comes to pass and 
which I will not be considering here) in The Star Fraction, a libertarian, 
anarcho-capitalist society in both isolated and universalist form in The Stone 
Canal, a socialist Stirnerite anarchy in The Cassini Division, and in The Sky 
Road, an ecotopia which may or may not be anarchic or libertarian, depending on 
one’s definition. The common threads between the three established utopias are 
the rejection of the state as the primary means of organisation, and the 
assertion of utopia as a necessarily civilised and technological project, rather 
than as a retreat to primitivism.</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Intrusion</i> is a sort of low-key dystopia set in a 
New Labour inspired surveillance society and nanny state, in which a pregnant 
mother resists pressure to conform by taking &#39;the fix&#39;, a pill that corrects 
defects lurking in the child&#39;s genome. Cory Doctorow&#39;s 
<a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/03/01/ken-macleods-intrusion.html">boingboing</a> review says &quot;MacLeod himself is a Marxist who is lauded by libertarians, and his unique 
	perspective, combined with a flair for storytelling, yields up a haunting, 
	gripping story of resistance, terror, and an all-consuming state that 
	commits its atrocities with the best of intentions.&quot; The novel is &quot;highly 
recommended&quot; by
<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/12/22/intrusion-by-ken-macleod-a-modern-1984/">
Zeke Teflon</a>, for whom this is &quot;the best near-future dystopian sci-fi novel 
that’s appeared&nbsp;in years.&quot; Teflon, however, is annoyed by MacLeod&#39;s 
&quot;impenetrable Britishisms and (is this even a word?) Scottishisms&quot;; this side of 
the Atlantic MacLeod&#39;s uncompromising use of the language is refreshing.<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;<p class="aplaintext">
<i>The Human Front Plus</i> is one of the PM Press short books coupling a title 
novella with a short or an essay, an author interview, and a bibliography. In 
this case the novella is an entertaining alternate history. In the interview 
(with Terry Bisson), when asked whether he would describe himself as a 
libertarian, Macleod replied &quot;. . . I don&#39;t call myself a Libertarian, in the 
sense of a supporter of the Libertarian Party or anything like that. My usual 
handwave for my position is &quot;hard-left libertarian&quot; but in practice I just vote 
Labour.&quot;<p class="aplaintext">

Spanish anarchist utopia, set in what was just thirteen years in the future at 
the time of writing.
<a href="https://publish.lib.umd.edu/scifi/article/view/278/41">Rodriquez</a> 
gives the following summary:<p class="aplaintext">
&nbsp;<p class="blockquote">
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; &amp;#xa">This 
short political novel narrates the peaceful triumph of libertarian communism in 
Spain following a general strike declared by anarcho-syndicalist unions, which 
represent most of the population, thus expanding the already large base of 
Spanish anarchists at that time. Money, private property, and all prior 
institutions are peacefully extinguished as anarchist unions take over their 
functions.</span><p class="aplaintext">
&nbsp;<p class="aplaintext">
Martínez Rizo was vice-president of the CNT&#39;s Sindicato de Obreros Intelectuales 
in Barcelona, and his familiarity with the CNT and FAI is clear in his 
first-person utopia. Jesse Cohn&#39;s <i><a href="biblio.htm#Cohn 2014">Underground 
Passages</a> </i>has a few pages on this work, noting the author&#39;s attention to 
what he calls the &#39;moral&#39; process of emancipation, which takes place at 
different rates for different people, as well as his use of language which he 
finds &quot;remarkably similar to the kind of linguistic transformation Orwell 
witnessed in the freshly liberated Barcelona&quot; of 1936.<p class="aplaintext">

Lord Humongous has a following. He&#39;s clearly in charge and his band of marauders 
provide a level of collective security not available to most people living 
there. In Somalia, people are struggling in a more open and less structured 
fashion, but there is still a level of everyday order. Money is being made by 
some people and there is enough stability for some people to spend their money 
on goods (e.g. food, fuel, clothing) and services (e.g. pirating is a service 
that some people in Somalia provide). <br>
<br>
What do you think? Does a place like the anarchical Somalia or post-Apocalyptic 
Australia have something to offer that a governed society lacks? </p>

Bread and Roses. An Utopian Survey and Blue-Print</a></i> (1944)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">
Mannin was best known as a writer of popular novels, but she was also an 
anarchist, and as such wrote <i>Bread and Roses, </i>a survey of historical 
utopian writing, drawing on her contemporary world, and reflecting her own 
utopian thinking. It foreshadows in some ways Marie-Louise Berneri&#39;s <i>Journey 
Through Utopia. </i>Mannin&#39;s concluded:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">
And that Utopia must be the stateless society of the anarchist ideal, a free and 
ungoverned society living according to the natural law of mutual aid, the 
present writer is convinced. And that is must be communist-anarchist.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">

<p class="blockquote">Ask who is the writer who has contributed most in the 
English language to the spread of libertarian ideas and you will get some 
peculiar answers, probably one of them some obscure Canadian professor whom 
nobody reads except as prescribed in the university curriculum [<i>Meltzer is 
clearly referring to George Woodcock</i>]. You might well get the same answer 
from Ethel Mannin, but for my money it is she who deserves the maximum credit, 
and seems to have received none that I know of. She was writing on sex and 
women&#39;s liberation fifty years ago and has introduced anarchist ideas in 
numerous works of fact and&nbsp;fiction. </p>

<h3>Louise Michel: <i>
The 
Human Microbes </i>
(1886); <i>The New World </i>(1888)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Among the literary works of the French anarchist Louise 
Michel is <i>The Human Microbes</i>, described by Santo Catanuto as &quot;a Jules Verne-style &#39;science 
fiction&#39; novel&quot;. (Catanuto: 30) An English translation by Brian Stableford was 
published in 2012, and it now appears that Catanuto&#39;s description is wide of the 
mark. It is in fact a lurid short novel, written while Michel was in solitary 
confinement in prison, described in the blurb as &quot;like Eugène Sue on speed&quot;. Not 
itself sf at all, it was planned as the first of a six-novel series, of which 
only one further novel appeared—<i>The New World</i> (also translated by 
Stableford and published in 2012; there is a passing mention of Bakunin); it 
seems that the series, as projected, would have developed to depict not just the 
worldwide transformation of Earth but an expansion to other worlds, which in 
Stableford&#39;s words &quot;would indeed have made it an unparalleled epic of anarchist 
scientific romance.&quot; (introduction to the Black Coat Press edition). Both 
novels are referred to in the 2014 <i>Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary.</i></p>

<p class="aplaintext">Michael Moorcock, described by Vittorio Curtoni as a &quot;bizarre beatnik figure&quot; (25), has been involved in politics for much
of his life, having been first attracted, by his own account, by the anarchist movement of the 1950s (Moorcock 1983:
12). At that time he used to attend anarchist meetings in Brylcreemed hair, blazer, tie and flannels, rather than orthodox
bohemian wear; contrariwise he would wear beatnik clothes to a church fete (ibid.: 75). He later joined successively
Labour, Liberal, and Labour parties, finally reverting to anarchism.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">In 1978, at Stuart Christie's request, he contributed '<a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/essay/starship-stormtroopers">Starship Stormtroopers: Anarchist and Authoritarian Ideas in
Science Fiction</a>' to the fourth issue of the <i>Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review</i>; this article is one of the major sources on this theme, 
and surely the best-known.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">In 1983 Moorcock published his political testament, 
<i>The Retreat from Liberty</i>. He speaks knowledgeably of historical anarchism, referring to Proudhon, Kropotkin, Stirner, Berkman, and Voline (his 1982 novel
<i>The Brothel in Rosenstrasse, </i>which is not sf, also mentions Bakunin). Among contemporaries he refers to the British anarchists Stuart Christie, Albert Meltzer, and Nicolas Walter, and to the American Noam Chomsky. With the then marginal state of the anarchist movement, he pinned his hopes for the future on the women's movement.</p>

		<p class="aplaintext">In <i>The Black Corridor</i>, against the disintegration of British society, a businessman escapes into space; he is, however, progressively shown to be no better than the world he is escaping. A very bitter and pessimistic work, it does however insist on the individual's responsibility for the creation of a decent society, and the necessity for means to correspond to ends.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext"><i>Breakfast in the Ruins </i>is a sequence of vignettes of Karl Glogauer at dates from 1871 to 1990—key historical loci, from the Paris Commune to Vietnam, via Auschwitz. He is frequently shown, coldly, as perpetrator as well as victim of atrocities. Chapter 9 features Glogauer with the army of Nestor Makhno, the Ukrainian anarchist of the 1920s. Makhno himself is shown as miserable but reckless and cruel. The novel is shockingly amoral in presentation, but presumably with the intention of forcing a reappraisal of the reader's moral stance.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Warlord of the Air </i>is a quasi-Griffithian story of a time-traveller, airships, and a utopian community. Anarchists are prominent, but are not very favourably portrayed—they are the first, for example, to use the atomic bomb. The book slurs over the differences between socialism, communism, and anarchism, but as no more than a potboiler can't be expected to be good propaganda. 
That said, <a href="http://airshipambassador.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/killjoy1/">
Margaret Killjoy</a> has described this as &quot;the ultimate proto-steampunk, if you 
ask me, and probably the punkest steampunk to date&quot;.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Cornelius Chronicles</i> constitute some of Moorcock's best work, centring on the attempts of Jerry Cornelius, a sort of transcendental hippie James Bond, to relate to the late twentieth century world. Nestor Makhno's army is again encountered. On this occasion it is in wild alliance with an army of Scottish anarchists and their fleet of a hundred airships painted in black anarchist livery and St Andrew's crosses. The opportunist Cornelius, known as a Makhnovist sympathiser, winds up as governor in Kiev. Andrew Hedgecock, writing in 
		<i>Freedom</i> in 1986, saw Cornelius as 
&quot;a template for Moorcock's ironic attacks on authoritarianism, racism and traditionally defined gender roles&quot;; on this seminal tetralogy the author declines to editorialise, compelling enhanced reader participation—hence the 
&quot;narrative is consonant with the central notion that self discipline is a necessary condition for freedom.&quot; 
Moorcock confirms this: </p>
		<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">The whole point of my fiction is to allow readers to decide for themselves their 
own moral attitudes. The Jerry Cornelius stories, for instance, are pure 
anarchism in their refusal to "guide" the reader in any direction. I try to set 
out the material and let them decide what they think. (<a href="k.htm#Killjoy">Killjoy</a>,
2009)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">This is entirely consistent with his statement, the same 
year, that </p>
		<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="blockquote">I remain a Kropotkinist anarchist, which many 
		people will see as unrealistic, but, if I’m unrealistic, so be it. I see 
		my anarchism as a moral position, in that it’s scarcely a realistic

		action to take. [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141215223241/http:/anarchotranshumanism.com:80/2009/06/23/moorcock-on-h-and-anarchism/">Moorcock

<h3>Alan Moore &amp; Dave Gibbons: <i>Watchmen </i>(1986)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Alan Moore first got 
involved in radical politics in the 1960s. Since his 20s he has seen himself as 
an anarchist: &quot;it seems to me that anarchy is the state that most naturally 
obtains when you're talking about ordinary human beings living their lives in a 
natural way.&quot; (Strangers in a Tangled Wilderness, 2007; republished in

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Watchmen</i> is a truly remarkable 
comic book alternate history with darkly and richly characterised superheroes 
and a story that cautions against trusting heroes and leaders of any 
description: who watches the watchmen? Not least among those extolling its 
virtues is Michael Moorcock, who has said that &quot;What was especially substantial 
about Moore&#39;s work was not the innovations, the new riffs on the super-hero 
theme, but the fundamental question of the nature of power and those we invest 
with power.&quot; (Moorcock 2012, reprinting a 2003 review.) Moorcock also wrote the

and <i>V for Vendetta</i> as &quot;sophisticated moral parables far and away more 
stimulating and interesting than most of the fiction being produced then or 
now&quot;. Both works are also noted in the 2014 <i>Bottled Wasp Pocket Diary.</i></p>

<h3><a name="Moore"></a>Alan Moore &amp; David Lloyd: <i>V for Vendetta</i> (1988, 
1989)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Set in a near future London where a fascist state took over after the Bombs were dropped, with V 
&quot;the kind of Guy Fawkes style hero who starts blowing up monuments and bases of operation. He basically proclaims himself to be an anarchist in a rather touching scene involving a statue of Lady Justice, where he is lamenting about how she betrayed him and he has found a new lover now, Anarchy. It goes into the whole psychology of being a revolutionary terrorist and what brought him to this point, and they switch to a lot of different POVs. . . . In one part of the comic in a speech, V tells the people how he can only do what he can do to remove the State Apparatus but once they are free they must make their own decisions upon what to do, and if they want to repeat the mistakes of the past. It is pretty brilliant . . .&quot;. (posting to anarchysf)</span></p>

		<h3>
<a name="Morris"></a>William Morris: <i>
<a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/newsfromnowhere00morriala">News from Nowhere</a></i> (1890; revised 1892)	<img border="0" src="../anarchy_symbol.GIF" width="23" height="21">; <i>
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16897/16897-h/16897-h.htm">The Tables
Turned; or, Nupkins Awakened: A Socialist Interlude</a></i> (1887)</span></span></h3>

<p class="aplaintext">In 1886 Morris invited Kropotkin, whom he had recently met, and liked immediately, to write for his paper, 
<i>The Commonweal</i>, but he declined. It was probably through Morris's early contact with Kropotkin, though, that the Commonweal press facilities were used to print 
<i>Freedom</i>. That year, in a letter, he spoke of 
&quot;us semi-anarchists&quot;, which is really as close to anarchism as Morris ever admitted to (Mackail 11:149). In a letter the following year, he wrote: 
&quot;I distinctly disagree with the Anarchist principle, much as I sympathise with many of the anarchists personally, and although I have an Englishman's wholesome horror of government interference and centralisation . . .&quot; (Morris 1951:5). In 
'Socialism and Anarchism', a letter in <i>Commonweal</i> on 5th May 1889, Morris wrote: 
&quot;I will begin by saying that I call myself a Communist, and have no wish to 
qualify that word by joining any other to it.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">He himself was always well-liked by anarchists. An anonymous commentator in 
<i>Freedom</i> in 1891 observed that 
&quot;Like other people, Anarchists admire his artistic genius, but, in addition, 
there is not an Anarchist worth his salt who, being acquainted with William 
Morris, does not respect him as a good comrade and an honest man.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext"><i>News from Nowhere</i>—&quot;A vision rather than a dream&quot; of a utopian future—was written as a libertarian response to Bellamy's 
<i>Looking Backward</i>. The polity is described as communist throughout, as one would expect, but the vision parallels closely many people's notions of an ideal anarchist society. No attempt to précis the book could possibly do it justice. Perhaps a single clue to its appeal might be found in Chapter XIII, 
'Concerning Politics'—which is just twelve lines long, &quot;because we have none.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">Anarchists have generally taken Morris's tale to their hearts. For an anonymous 
<i>Freedom</i> writer of 1891, 
&quot;Comrade Morris is not avowedly an Anarchist by conviction; but in character he is a born-Anarchist, and in very much of his writing—for instance, News from Nowhere—the most hypercritical of Anarchists would have to borrow a pair of spectacles to discover serious points of disagreement.&quot; Peter Kropotkin, in his 1896 memorial to Morris, described 
<i>News from Nowhere </i>as 
&quot;perhaps the most thoroughly and deeply Anarchistic conception of future society that has ever been written. . . . his ideal society is undoubtedly the one which is most free of all our State and monastic traditions; the most imbued with the feelings of equality and humanitarian love; the most spontaneously growing out of a spirit of free understanding.&quot;(109) Much later Jeff Cloves, in 
		<i>Freedom</i> in 1968, summed up the feelings of many: 
&quot;I'm not bothered by jeers about the impracticality and implausibility of News from Nowhere. All that I know is that when I read it, I think . . . that's what I want, that's how life ought to be.&quot; 
Murray Bookchin, in his <i>The Ecology of Freedom, </i>refers to Morris as &quot;my 
favorite utopian&quot;.</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">With <i>The Dispossessed, News from Nowhere </i>ranks as one of the two essential texts in the context of this guide.</span></span></p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">In the 
lightweight satirical playlet <i>The Tables Turned</i>, &quot;the sleeper who awakes in a
libertarian-socialist society in Part II is the corrupt judge who presides over
the farcical trial of socialists and anarchists in Part I.&quot; (The pre-revolution 
Part 1 is much the longer of the two parts.) &quot;There, he has to face
the Council of the Commune (the general assembly of the local population,
or folk-mote), who refuse to waste chains by shackling him, or to take care
of him in a prison (they have none, anyway), but instead teach him to do
useful work farming so that he might become a self-employed individual like
everyone else.&quot; (Dan Clore)</span></p>

&#39;anarchism&#39; these days among young American activists without IMO making is seem 
much more appealing than it is in real life.&quot; Another thought &quot;it&#39;s got more to

the point, it&#39;s capitalist reformism all over again&quot;; &quot;The show does not play to 
anarchist philosophy(s), it acts as a reservoir for anyone alienated or who 
feels occasionally alienated by the current blah.&quot; But the last response 
prompted a different viewpoint: &quot;[ . . . ] I would argue that the general 
anti-capitalist/anti-corporate themes do, in fact, &quot;play to&quot; anarchist 
philosophy. Nobody seems to espouse any anarchist philosophy, per se, but the 
fact that anarchist ideas and tendencies are the primary driver of the plot, 
without explicitly saying it, actually makes the show that much more subversive 
and effective in my opinion.&quot; A new post on

<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Tribunal</i> is a lightweight near-future political 
thriller, involving the declaration of independence of Acquitaine and the

smuggle arms into Acquitaine, saw the leaning tower as a symbol of government

gunpowder.</p>

connections at the unconscious level which revealed the mechanisms of the human 
psyche, and translated the idea in a series of brilliant novels [ . . . ] and 
stories&quot; (25); he only named these four. For

<p class="aplaintext">Michael Moorcock's 1978 article in the <i>Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review</i> singles out 
<i>The Atrocity Exhibition</i> and <i>Crash</i> for
inclusion among books which in his view promote libertarian ideas. He comments that they have 
&quot;brought criticisms of
'nihilism' against him&quot; (43). Both works are innovatory in sf, and have an impersonal and amoral quality which perhaps
gives rise to such criticisms. They are libertarian in the sense of challenging orthodoxy, of iconoclasm.
<i>Crash</i> is described as &quot;seminal&quot; in a 2013

<a name="Banks"></a>Iain 
M. Banks: <i>Culture </i>series—<i>Consider Phlebas </i>(1987), <i>The Player of Games</i> (1988), 
<i>The State of the Art </i> (1989; expanded as a collection 1991)<i>, Use of Weapons</i> (1990), <i>Excession</i>
(1996),<i> Inversions </i> (1998); <i> Look to Windward</i> (2000), <i>Matter </i>
(2008), <i>Surface Detail</i> (2010), <i>The Hydrogen Sonata</i> (2012)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">This popular series showcases an implicitly anarchist post-scarcity society, enabled by nanotechnology. 
Banks himself said, of the Culture, &quot;Essentially, the contention is that our 
currently dominant power systems cannot long survive in space; beyond a certain 
technological level a degree of anarchy is arguably inevitable and anyway 
preferable.&quot; More specifically, he argued that &quot;the mutuality of dependence 
involved in an environment which is inherently hostile would necessitate an 
internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness 
typifying the relations between such ships/habitats. Succinctly; socialism 
within, anarchy without.&quot; Politically, &quot;one of the few rules the Culture adheres 
to with any exactitude at all is that a person&#39;s access to power should be in 
inverse proportion to their desire for it.&quot; [<a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm">&#39;A Few 
Notes on the Culture&#39;</a>]</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">According to the 2014 <i>Bottled Wasp Pocket 
Diary</i> &quot;A non-anarchist, he has been one of the few such to approach 
depicting a real (if imaginary) anarchist society with any conviction or 
accuracy, although a significant number of anarchists might dispute that 
statement.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Of <i>Look to Windward, </i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_To_Windward">Wikipedia</a> notes &#39;This book deals with the 
themes of exile, bereavement, religious justification of mass violence against 
humanity/sentience in war, and the mores associated with life within a 
technologically and energetically unlimited anarchist utopia.&#39;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">All these novels are included in Zeke Teflon&#39;s

<a href="http://syndicalist.us/2013/07/11/anarchist-science-fiction/">McKay</a> 
enjoyed all the Culture books, finding only <i>Matter</i> disappointing, with <i>
Surface Detail</i> the most fun. In my own view, <i>Inversions</i> is the most 
unusual, but perhaps the most subtle.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The title novella forming the greater part of 
the <i>State of the Art</i> collection is of particular interest, for two 
reasons: it is in some ways the most accessible of the Culture series, by its 
explicit contrast with an Earth of the 1970s and, as the <i>
<a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/banks_iain_m">SFE</a></i> puts it, 
&quot;for the only time, it openly advocates some aspects of the Culture as a model

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">The point of this anarchist utopia [i.e. the Culture] is not that there’s 
some ignored power relation at work that compromises its integrity, or even that 
you can have too much of a good thing. It’s a more subtle and complex message 
about inertia and entropy, of the nature of power and privilege, and the need for 
change and development, personal and societal, even in the face of seeming 
perfection.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">For Martin H., writing in <i>Workers Solidarity</i> in 2000, &quot;Banks clearly knew his 
anarchism&quot;, and the Culture series &quot;flesh out what it might be like to live in 
an anarchist society.&quot;</p>

<h3>
Barrington J. Bayley: <i>Annihilation Factor </i>(1964); <i>The Soul of the 
Robot</i> (1974)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Annihilation Factor </i>includes the character Castor Krakhno, based on Nestor Makhno. (Dan Clore). Included in
<i><a href="k.htm#Killjoy">Killjoy</a>&#39;s
</i>list of stories that feature sympathetic 
anarchist characters.
The Krakhno character, however, is largely a caricature 19th century villainous 
anarchist, about whom even the author seems ambivalent. The anarchism, such as 
it is, is both nihilist and individualist.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&quot;I admire Barrington J. Bayley, whose 
stories are often extremely abstract. One of the most enjoyable recently 
published is <i>The Soul of the Robot</i> which discusses the nature of 
individual identity.&quot; (Moorcock 1978) The novel concerns the quest of the 
robot Jasperodus for his own identity—is his consciousness real or fake, has he 
a soul? He has, but not a constructed one. Although the reader takes pleasure in 
Jasperodus&#39;s refusal to take orders and insistence that he alone is the 
initiator of his deeds, he himself is no more to be admired in his ethical 
behaviour than his would-be masters; and the excess of palace intrigue detracts 
from the undoubted interest of some of the book&#39;s philosophical discussions.</p>&nbsp;<h3>Edward Bellamy: <i>
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/624/624-h/624-h.htm">Looking Backward 
2000–1887</a></i> (1888); <i>
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/equal10h.htm">Equality</a></i> (1897) 
</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In Bellamy&#39;s influential utopia <i>Looking Backward</i> 
the economy of the future United States is highly organized, workers being 
organized in an industrial army. We learn that</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&quot;Almost the sole function of the administration now is 
that of directing the industries of the country. Most of the purposes for which 
governments formerly existed no longer remain to be subserved. We have no army 
or navy, and no military organization. We have no departments of state or 
treasury, no excise or revenue services, no taxes or tax collectors. The only 
function proper of government, as known to you, which still remains, is the 
judiciary and police system.&quot; (Signet Classic edn: 143-4)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Bellamy takes this further in <i>Equality</i>:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&quot;A government in the sense of a co-ordinating directory of 
our associated industries we shall always need, but that is practically all the 
government we have now. It used to be a dream of philosophers that the world 
would some time enjoy such a reign of reason and justice that men would be able 
to live together without laws. That condition, so far as concerns punitive and 
coercive regulations, we have practically attained. As to compulsory laws, we 
might be said to live almost in a state of anarchy.&quot; (1933 Appleton-Century edn: 
409)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">This sounds well enough; but, as Marie-Louise Berneri put 
it,</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&quot;Bellamy&#39;s state socialism allows a greater degree of 
personal freedom than most other utopias based on the same principles. But it is 
the freedom which might be granted to soldiers once they have been conscripted; 
no provision is made for &#39;conscientious objectors&#39; (249).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">While <i>Looking Backward</i> and its sequel are not in themselves anarchist, 
they nevertheless attracted the interest of Peter Kropotkin himself. He reviewed the first at great length (extending over four issues) in <i>Le R&eacute;volté</i> at the end of 1889, noting that 
&quot;Bellamy&#39;s ideal is not ours. But he helps to clarify our own ideas; on many points, without intending to, he confirms them.&quot; (Pt 1:1). He concluded: 
&quot;Whatever may be the defects of this little book, it will always have done the immense service of suggesting ideas and giving matter for discussion for those who really wish for the social Revolution.&quot; (Pt 4:2). Lest there be any doubt, though, he stated right at the start of his article that 
&quot;Bellamy n&#39;est pas anarchiste&quot; (Pt 1:1). Kropotkin found <i>Equality</i> certainly not so interesting, but superior in that it analyses 
&quot;all the vices of the capitalistic system. . . so admirably that I know of no other Socialist work on this subject that equals Bellamy&#39;s <i>Equality.&quot;</i> These remarks on<i> Equality</i> come from Kropotkin's obituary notice of Bellamy in <i>Freedom, </i>translated from <i>Les Temps Nouveaux.</i> His final considered opinion:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">What a pity that Bellamy has not lived longer! He would 
have produced other excellent books. I am positive that were Bellamy to have met 
an Anarchist who could have explained to him our ideal, he would have accepted 
it. The authoritarianism which he introduced into his Utopia was useless there 
and contradictory to the very system. It was simply a survival, a concession, a 
tribute to the past.</p>

Belle Verte </i>(<i>The Green Beautiful; </i>1996, dir. Coline Serreau)</h3>
		<p class="aplaintext">On a tiny Earth-like alien planet, the decision is taken 
to send a volunteer to Earth. Earth is seen as backward by the seemingly human 
aliens, and at first no-one wants to volunteer. One woman eventually raises her 
hand, curious because her mother was from Earth. The visit to Earth portrays the 
Paris of the present, but she is later joined by her two sons who initially land 
in Australia and are given a warm reception by aboriginal people whom the sons 
instantly take to as far more advanced (as in tune with their environment) than 
the western world encountered by their mother. The middle segment of the 
film tells the story of the visit to Earth, the first and third acts depicting 
life on the alien planet, which is quite idyllic and very solarpunk anarchist. 
The film is a delightful family comedy, with gentle satiric fun at the expense 
of the unenlightened Earthlings.</p>

<h3>Hilaire Belloc: <i>But Soft—We Are Observed</i> (1928)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">This light political satire hangs on a mistaken identity / 
pursuit story. By 1979 &quot;The parliaments of the Great Powers had long ago settled 
down into two sober parties, Communist on the right and Anarchist on the left, 
who between them maintained the Majestic Rotation of Representative Government . 
. . &quot; (Arrowsmith edn: 57) Lady Caroline Balcombe, the Foreign Secretary, had 
said in a famous statement of 1952:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&quot;I am as profoundly attached to Anarchy, and to all the 
principles of Anarchy, as any woman or man here present. But the only Anarchy I 
know is an Anarchy to be achieved by Constitutional Means.&quot; (87)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Clearly this shouldn&#39;t be taken too seriously; however it 
is suggestive of the durability of political institutions and their ability to 
absorb dissent.</p>

<h3>Gregory Benford</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In 1980 Benford said, in an interview with Charles Platt, 
that</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">. . . many social issues could be solved by simple 
rational planning—I don&#39;t mean top-down planning, but by using the adroitness 
and competitive spirit of the small scale. In that sense, I&#39;m sort of an 
unvarnished capitalist, not because I believe in the ownership of things, but

<h3>Donald E. Bensen: <i>And Having Writ . . . </i>(1978)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Alien astronauts crashland on Earth in 1908 causing, in 
the original universe (ours), the Tungus meteorite phenomenon. They represent 
themselves as ambassadors from a galactic empire, whilst actually only wishing 
to speed up technological progress in order to repair their craft, and have 
various escapades with H.G. Wells, Rasputin, Theodore Roosevelt, etc. <i>And 
Having Writ . . .</i> is not really in any way anarchist, but it does present a 
delightful satire of Earthly ways, and it gently mocks a variety of authority 
figures. All in all, great fun.</p>

<h3><a name="Berneri"></a>Marie Louise Berneri: <i>Journey through Utopia</i> (1950)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Berneri was an Italian-born anarchist, a member of the 
group centred on the newspaper <i>Freedom </i>and its stable-mates, and one of 
the four editors of <i>War Commentary</i> tried in 1945 for incitement to 
disaffection, but acquitted as her husband Vernon Richards was a co-defendant, 
and legally she couldn&#39;t conspire with him. She died in childbirth aged just 31.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Her notable survey of utopias was published 
the year after her death. Although much of the survey reviews the familiar 
historical utopias, she also looked at more recent utopian (and dystopian) 
works, including Lytton&#39;s <i>The Coming Race,</i> Bellamy&#39;s <i>Looking Backward</i>, 
Morris&#39;s <i>News from Nowhere</i>, Wells&#39;s <i>A Modern Utopia </i>and <i>Men 
Like Gods, </i>Zamyatin&#39;s <i>We</i>, and Huxley&#39;s <i>Brave New World </i>(Orwell<i>&#39;</i>s<i> 
Nineteen Eighty-Four </i>being published too late for inclusion).</p>

&nbsp;<h3>Alfred Bester: <i>The Demolished Man </i>(1953); <i>The Stars My Destination (</i>a.k.a. <i>Tiger! Tiger!) </i>(1956)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">John Pilgrim wrote:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">On a more popular level a libertarian idea is often thrown 
away casually with no real discussion, nevertheless its presence can alter the 
slant of the book. Alfred Bester&#39;s <i>The Demolished Man</i>, for instance. This 
is a science fiction detective story set at a period when telepathy has become 
an accepted power for a large part of the population and psychotherapeutic 
techniques are much further advanced than at present. People like the 
hero/villain Reich who want a return to the 20th Century system of power 
politics are regarded as sick people and treated as such. At the end of the book 
this conversation occurs: &quot;Three or four hundred years ago the cops used to 
catch people like Reich just to kill them. Capital punishment they called it [. 
. .] But it doesn&#39;t make sense. If a man&#39;s got the guts and talent to buck 
society he&#39;s obviously above average . . . You want to turn him into a plus 
value . . . Why throw him away? Do that enough times and all you have left are 
the sheep&quot;. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe in those days they wanted sheep&quot;.</p>
<p class="blockquote">This particular novel, a popular entertainment mind, not a 
philosophical dissertation, ends in an outburst from one of the protagonists in 
which the following words occur: &quot;. . . <i>there is nothing in man but love and 
faith and courage, kindness, generosity and sacrifice. All else is but the 
barrier of your blindness</i> . . .&quot; Such lines may not be brilliant, or new to 
the readers of this journal [<i>Freedom</i>], perhaps, but they are surely a new 
thing in <i>popular</i> fiction. (Pilgrim 1963)</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Demolished Man </i>isn&#39;t quite the 
libertarian novel that Pilgrim suggests. The future society shown, though it can 
redeem &#39;criminals&#39;, still has all the trappings of the state and capitalism; and 
telepathy, for all its potential to spread sympathy and understanding, is 
principally shown as just a new weapon in the armoury of repression.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Of <i>The Stars My Destination </i>Moorcock wrote: 
&quot;This is one of the very few libertarian sf novels I have ever read. That it was the first and turned me on to reading sf is probably the purest accident. [. . .] I know of no other sf book which so thoroughly combines romance with an idealism almost wholly acceptable to me . . .&quot; (Moorcock 
1978: 43). He particularly commends the conclusion in which the hero, Gully Foyle, delivers PyrE, the ultimate weapon, to the outcasts of the Earth, for them to repossess their future. Foyle justifies himself: 
&quot;&#39;Who are we, any of us, to make a decision for the world? Let the world make its own decisions. Who are we to keep secrets from the world? Let the world know and decide for itself.&#39;&quot; (Penguin edn, p. 242) 
The book won the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1988. For 
Evan
<a href="http://tashqueedagg.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/alfred-bester-the-stars-my-destination/">
Lampe</a>, the book reminds him &quot;of the need, from time to time, to embrace 
those systemic shocks that may not promise permanent freedom but do create 
spaces for autonomy.&quot;</p>
&nbsp;<h3>Eando Binder: &#39;Giants of Anarchy&#39; (1939)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Dire pulp story, originally published in <i>Weird Tales</i>, 
in the June-July issue of 1939. The principal character travels 10,000 years 
into the future, and finds that the world has become an Anarchy. But in this 
case all it means is that, following the release of limitless atomic power, 
evolution tended in the direction of a diminishing population, as &quot;better minds 
saw no reason for allowing poorer, duller minds to exist, and warred on them&quot;. 
With the demise of government, the survivors spend all their time duelling in 
giant battle-machines, apparently for want of anything better to do, while at 
the same time all concepts of love and friendship have been forgotten. The hero, 
his girlfriend, and her scientist father have no difficulty in convincing 
everyone to &quot;forget their differences and live with one another peacefully&quot;, 
claiming that they will &quot;found a new co-operative union here in this mad world 
of Anarchy!&quot;</p>

<h3>Terry Bisson: <i>Fire on the Mountain</i> (1988); <i>TVA Baby and other 
stories</i> (2011)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Fire on the Mountain </i>is socialist rather than 
anarchist, but is an astonishingly convincing alternate history predicated on 
John Brown&#39;s success in the raid at Harper&#39;s Ferry in 1859. Of very real 
interest. It has recently been reviewed in the Winter 2019 <i>Fifth Estate</i> 
by RB, who finds fault with Bisson&#39;s understanding of the true history of the 
raid, and dislikes what he sees as &quot;Bisson&#39;s utopia: a technocratic mega-state 
that valorizes total domination of nature.&quot;</p>

<h3><img border="0" src="covers/blackpanther.jpg" width="32" height="44"> <i>
Black Panther</i> (2018, dir. Ryan Coogler)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Superhero film with a predominantly black cast, and with 
strong women characters. While it can be seen as Afrofuturism, and as sending 
strong messages about diversity and empowerment, and while it has drawn positive 
comments on Facebook&#39;s Anarchist Solarpunk and Sci-Fi Libertarian Socialist 
pages, I found it quite disappointing: while supposedly depicting Africa in a 
progressive way, it spends as much time presenting traditional tribal images and 
rituals as it does in demonstrating the technological superiority of the 
Wakandan state; the story line is corny as hell, and is depressingly centred on 
elite struggles for supremacy in a traditional monarchy; and the tokenistic 
conclusion in which the king finally agrees to share some of Wakanda&#39;s wealth 
with African Americans in Oakland altogether fails to redeem the film from its 
desperate conventionality. I&#39;m not familiar with the comic books from which the 
film is derived, but surely the film betrays its pulpy origin. It comes across 
as a rehash of sf stories of the 1920s and 1930s (if not earlier). Full marks 
for casting, but F for failure of imagination. Well, to be charitable, it might 
be OK for kids.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The film was reviewed in <i>Fifth Estate</i> in Summer

&quot;attempted recuperation of black-produced black images&quot;:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">When reduced, the film&#39;s embrace of an autocratic ruler 
allied with the CIA willingly funneling resources to the West, does not depict a 
new future for Majority World nations populated by people of color. It depicts 
the one already created by imperialist intervention.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">But he concludes that <i>&quot;Black Panther</i> nevertheless 
could expand avenues of portraying blackness on the big screen.&quot;</p>

<p class="aplaintext"><i>A Case of Conscience</i> was discussed by John Pilgrim in his 1963 <i>Anarchy</i> article, for its ethical dimension. The society portrayed, though described by the author as Christian,  beyond which Pilgrim himself doesn't venture,  is in many ways anarchistic—an austere kind of Godwinian anarchism, its ethical system rooted in nature, as Godwin argued.

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pilgrim also looked at <i>They Shall Have Stars</i>: though he found the plot banal, he considered the novel

			<p class="blockquote">I’m comfortable with it by process of

			critical of any kind of organized left wing just because of 
			bureaucracy really becoming another class, and the relationship of 
			women to whatever organized left there is. So, the idea of anarchism 
			has always appealed to me simply because it’s always calling into 
			question that which is. I somehow see anarchism as that. I see it as 
			not necessarily excluding different political identifications. For 
			example, on one issue it might be possible to side with a socialist 
			stance, on another issue a very Western stance. But the thing about 
			anarchism is that it allows you not to have to be over-programmed. 
			The other thing is about feminists. What gets me now is people 
			saying that they’re not feminist anymore. Feminism is such a mild 
			word for how I consider myself, that I’m absolutely a feminist. 
			Anarcha-feminism to me has always been about stirring things up. You 
			try to constantly ask those questions which will prevent stasis from 
			setting in. Even at the expense of sometimes being seen as 
			contradictory or saying things that go against what you said a year 
			before or a minute before. For me it’s a process. We all know what’s 
			wrong with Western capitalism and we all know what’s wrong with the 
			extreme left, so anarcha-feminism—it just seems to be the only 
			viable identification, if one is to identify at all.</p>

science fiction movie. Peak rightly regards the character of Helmholtz Watson as 
&quot;the libertarian hero&quot; of this movie: Bernard G. Marx ultimately conforms, and 
in any case poses no threat, and John Savage, too, though interesting, is also a 
conformist. But Helmholtz &quot;most clearly represents the individualist spirit&quot; and 
is &quot;the most refreshing, inspiring, and interesting character offered in this 
teleplay.&quot;</p>

quotation from this book (Ward 1972: 64). Smallcreep is a factory assembly 
worker, who one day roves through the factory hoping to discover once and for 
all what he has been making all these years. The work as a whole is a very 
powerful protest against alienation; chapter Eight in particular contains an 
anguished confession from the managing director of his comprehension of the 
hypocrisy and unfairness of the system of authority which he represents. The 
managing director&#39;s devastating demolition of authority, and his vision of what 
a free society would be, may be presumed to represent Brown&#39;s own views: 
Smallcreep himself fails to understand them, which is Brown&#39;s pessimism—he, like 
the managing director, has no faith in his own visions, and can see no way out.</p>

<h3>Bulwer Lytton: <i>
<a href="http://ia311532.us.archive.org/0/items/thecomingrace01951gut/1951-h/1951-h.htm">The Coming Race</a> </i>(1871)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">William Godwin exerted a degree of influence on Lytton's writing, and Godwin wrote to Lytton admiring his early work <i>Paul Clifford</i>. Godwin even gave support to Lytton when the latter stood for parliament. But George Woodcock notes that though Lytton 
&quot;had a real admiration for Godwin as a philosopher&quot; he was &quot;most attracted to him as a novelist&quot; (Woodcock 1946:231).<i>The Coming Race</i> is the work by which Lytton is chiefly remembered in science fiction circles. It is a utopia set underground, in which social relations have been drastically modified since the discovery of 
'vril', an almost magical source of unlimited energy available to every individual. Political power is thus rendered inoperable: 
&quot;Man was so completely at the mercy of man, each whom he encountered being able, if so willing, to slay him on the instant, that all notions of government by force gradually  vanished from political systems and forms of law.&quot; (Steiner pb edn: 56). Marie-Louise Berneri (242) detected Godwin's influence in Lytton's model of a stateless society. Angel Cappelletti (1966:31) additionally hints at some influence from Proudhon. But  without suggesting direct influence  perhaps Woodcock's suggestion is closest, namely that Lytton's utopia is similar to the world of Stirnerite egoists.</p>
&nbsp;<h3><a name="Burdekin"></a>Katherine Burdekin (writing as Murray 
Constantine): <i>Swastika Night</i> (1937)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">For Moorcock, the novel &quot;seems to think that Christianity 
could conquer Hitler but is otherwise a pretty incisive projection of Nazism 
several hundred years in the future&quot;. (Moorcock 1978)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Eugene L. Burdick &amp; Harvey Wheeler: <i>Fail-Safe </i>(1962)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Tense thriller in which mechanical failure leads to a US 
nuclear attack on Moscow; to convince the Soviet leader that it was a mistake, 
the US president is forced to order the tit-for-tat destruction of New York. 
John Pilgrim in 1966 considered it to be in the tradition of Chesney&#39;s <i>The 
Battle of Dorking</i>, but its motivation is very different, being passionately 
opposed to nuclear escalation and the arms war.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Anthony Burgess: <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> (1962); <i>1985</i> (1978)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Burgess himself responded in the pages of <i>Freedom</i> to a review by Nicolas Walter of the film of his book. The novel concerns a violent delinquent youth who is forcibly conditioned to non-violent behaviour at the cost of his absorbing pleasure in music; he is eventually reconditioned to his old behaviour patterns. The near-anarchistic moral of the story is made explicit by Burgess in his later work, <i>1985</i>, which includes comments on <i>A Clockwork Orange:</i></p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">The unintended destruction of Alex's capacity for enjoying music symbolizes the State's imperfect understanding (or volitional ignorance) of the whole nature of man, and of the consequences of its own decisions. We may not be able to trust man—meaning ourselves—very far, but we must trust the State far less. (Arrow edn: 93).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">'1984'—the first part of Burgess's <i>1985—</i>displays an extensive knowledge of the anarchist movement, its history and philosophy. References to the Spanish Civil War or to Sacco &amp; Vanzetti are unusual but not unique in sf, but Burgess's mention of an anarchist youth movement in China's Yunan province almost certainly is. A chapter entitled 
'Bakunin's Children' actually incorporates a three-page biographical portrait of Bakunin, whom he describes as 
&quot;the rank meat in a more rational anarchical sandwich, tastier than the dry bread of theory that Proudhon offered before him and Kropotkin after.&quot; (69). Burgess argues that Bakunin's temperament, which urges him to destroy all that is old, led anarchists to reject the past, and that 
&quot;Anarchism, in rejecting the past and assuming that the new is, by a kind of Hegelian necessity, better than the old, opens the way to tyranny.&quot; (77) Thus, for Burgess, the world of Orwell's <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> has its intellectual origins in nineteenth-century anarchism. 
&quot;Anarchism is not possible. Bakunin is a dead prophet.&quot; (81) Nevertheless, Burgess clearly finds it appealing: though he says 
&quot;you can almost smell the cordite in the word&quot; (69) he finds its overtones &quot;terrible, and attractive&quot; (71). Essentially it is historical anarchism that Burgess rejects, rather than anarchism's roots in anti-statism and individualism. Having rejected Bakunin and Kropotkin, Burgess opts for Thoreau, 
&quot;the true patron saint&quot; (82) of the individual. &quot;The individual alone can be a true anarch.&quot; (82).</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; A Clockwork Orange </i>won the Libertarian

&nbsp;<h3>William S. Burroughs: <i>The Naked Lunch</i> (1959); <i>The Soft 
Machine</i> (1961/6); <i>Nova Express</i> (1966); <i>The Ticket That Exploded</i> 
(1968); <i>The Wild Boys </i>(1969), <i>Exterminator!</i> (1974); <i>Cities of the Red Night </i>(1981), 
<i>Ghost of Chance</i> (1991)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Burroughs&#39;s work is difficult to describe or classify, but 
most of his books have some sf interest, and among these all the above titles 
have been referred to in anarchist publications. The most characteristic and 
recurrent of his themes is stated succinctly in <i>The Naked Lunch</i>:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">&quot; . . . You see control can never be a means to any 
practical end . . . . It can never be a means to anything but more control . . . 
. Like junk . . .&quot; (164, Calder &amp; Boyars edn).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Dave Cunliffe, in his 1968 <i>Freedom</i> review of <i>The 
Soft Machine</i>, summed up Burroughs as &quot;a technological mystic and creative 
journalist with liberal and reformist tendencies&quot;. But &quot;his inspired solipsistic 
vision&quot; (Moorcock 1983: 71) represents more than this: his sympathies are 
libertarian and revolutionary. B.P.D., writing in <i>Freedom</i> in 1972, felt that &quot;To 
employ the term &#39;anarchist&#39; to such an individualist thinker as William 
Burroughs would be to categorise him wrongly and unnecessarily.&quot; But that he 
approached closely to anarchism is shown clearly in his 1969 interview with 
Daniel Odier, published as <i>The Job</i>. He says he is &quot;very dubious of 
politics myself&quot; (47), and believes that &quot;all existing governments are control 
machines&quot; (35); and when asked directly whether he believes in the anarchist 
solutions for the future he replies</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">I don&#39;t really know what they are, although I would say 
this, that I don&#39;t believe in any solution that proposes halfway measures. 
Unless we can abolish the whole concept of the nation, and the whole concept of 
the family, we aren&#39;t going to get anywhere at all, just nowhere. (65)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">He had no illusions about the (then current) hippie 
challenge to the system of control: &quot;The only way I like to see cops given 
flowers is in a flower-pot from a high window.&quot; (67)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&quot;While Burroughs work is primarily dystopian, a few anarchistic utopian societies do show up. In <i>The Wild Boys</i>, for example, Burroughs portrays an anarchistic society that consists of roving gangs of dope-smoking, homosexual teenage boys who wear nothing but jockstraps and rollerskates. The trilogy that begins with <i>Cities of the Red Night </i>includes material about several attempts to found libertarian societies, including Libertatia . . . and a group of Rimbaud-reading, dope-smoking, homosexual Zen gunslingers in the Wild West. <i>Ghost of Chance </i>stars Captain Mission and his pirate utopia Libertatia.&quot; (Dan Clore)</p>

<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Kindred</i> is probably Butler&#39;s best-known work, and 
is by now pretty much a standard text, featuring a complex critique of race and 
power relationships in the ante-bellum South, from the viewpoint of an 
African-American woman from 1976, who is intermittently pulled back to 1815 
whenever her slave-owning white forebear is in danger.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><i>Dawn</i>&#39;s most daring maneuver was not the 
unattractive aliens on the breathing bio-ship that rescued the xenophobic humans 
after a human holocaust—nor even the seemingly benevolent freaks&#39; rejection of 
humanity&#39;s apparently inherent hierarchies; rather, Butler busted boundaries 
with bizarre, kinky, and blissfully psychedelic interspecies sex. Even though 
the humans cannot help but like it, do they really want it? As one might 
imagine, the issue of permission is problematic here; do the humans choose to 
breed with their apparently terrifying and tentacled saviors and captors? Is 
this patronizing servitude masked as emancipation?</p>

rise of a movement based on mutual aid (or just common human decency) amid the

Carson, while relishing the mutual aid depicted, finds Butler&#39;s orientation

<h3>Samuel Butler: <i>Erewhon</i> (1872); <i>Erewhon Revisited</i> (1901)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>Erewhon</i> is a satirical utopia with dystopian 
elements, set in New Zealand. Established Western conventions are 
overturned—criminals are cured, but sickness punished; churches have become 
musical banks; machines have been banned because of fears of their possible role 
as evolutionary successors to Homo sapiens. The satire was familiar reading to a number of 
anarchists: Marie-Louise Berneri, Angel Cappelletti, Ethel Mannin, Herbert Read, 
and George Woodcock all refer to it. In this satire, for Cappelletti, &quot;is shown 
the singular taste of the author for inverting ideas and values commonly 
accepted, pleasure in turning the world upside down, and a caustic and 
subversive use of paradox&quot; . . . (Cappelletti 1966: 27)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>

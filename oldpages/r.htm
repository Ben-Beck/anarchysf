<h3 style="text-align: justify">Ayn Rand: <i>Anthem </i> (1938; abridged 1946); <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> 
(1957)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">Rand was far from being an anarchist 
(she once describe anarchy, as a political concept, as &quot;a naive floating 
abstraction&quot;), but her immense influence on the libertarian right and the anarcho-capitalists
can't be denied.</span> (Rand 1963) Murray Rothbard, a leading influence 
on the development of anarcho-capitalism, asserted in his 1973 work <i>For a New 
Liberty</i> that &quot;her philosophical influence remains prodigious on the great 
bulk of libertarian youth&quot; (15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext"><i>Anthem
</i>is a dystopia set after a future war, in which the only crime punishable by death is the speaking of the word
'I'; inevitably the hero rebels, and comes to regard the very word as a god. In its exaltation of egoism, and to some
extent in its style, it is reminiscent of Stirner's <i>The Ego and His Own</i>. 
It tied for the 1987<i> </i>Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext"><i>Atlas </i>Shrugged is Rand's most influential book, a sustained diatribe against socialism, in which the great industrialists
withdraw their 'services' to society as civilisation collapses, with a view to rebuilding capitalism on the ruins.</span> 
John Galt, Rand&#39;s messiah-figure, makes clear that there is no question of being 
opposed to the state as such; he regards police, army, and courts as the &quot;proper 
functions of a government&quot; (Signet pb edn: 987), and only opposes government <i>
initiation of force. </i>It tied for the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1983.</p>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align: justify">Herbert Read: <i>The Green Child</i> (1935)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">Utopian fantasy, meriting inclusion by virtue of Read's importance in the history of anarchism in Britain. George
Woodcock found this novel to be &quot;a parable illuminating the dialectic that runs through all of Read's works: the
necessary interplay between freedom and order, between reason and instinct, on which the organic reality of life as well
as of art depends.&quot; (Woodcock 1972a:77)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">Read invited Emma 
Goldman to tea in 1938, and became (with Ethel Mannin) one of the only two &quot;real 
comrades and friends&quot; that she made during her three years in London [Goodway:

<p style="text-align: justify" class="blockquote">The government, through technocratic means, has eliminated the need for most individuals to work, and has instituted
a Universal Guaranteed Income. Only those who come out on top when taking tests to determine their Ability Quotient
are able to obtain jobs. More and more, jobless individuals join communes and pursue their own interestsâ€”there are
communes for homosexuals, lesbians, artists, nudists, kids who hate everyone over thirty, swinging singles, and many
others. A government official objects that "An increasing number of the communards don't participate in even the civil
elections. Most aren't eligible to participate in the guild elections, because they hold no jobs, but they don't bother to
vote in the civil elections, either. To put it bluntly, they're anarchists." After the main character, who has been assigned
to investigate the communes, discovers that the communards are in a conspiracy to institute anarchism by eliminating the political state and transferring democracy to the economic sphere, one member tells him that they prefer the term libertarians.  Say anarchist to most people and they think in terms of bomb-throwing fanatics. (Reynolds was an activist with the syndicalist Socialist Labor Party.) (Dan Clore)</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify">Adam Roberts: <i>Salt</i> (2000); <i>Gradisil

<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext"><i>Salt </i>features two planetary colonist 
communities in ideological conflict, one of which is explicitly anarchistic in 
flavour. An intelligent and well-written debut novel. The author himselfâ€”a 
British academic and historian of sfâ€”says:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="blockquote">
I think I'm 
on safer ground when I mention the political and ideological issues that the 
book rehearses; questions of political affiliation, of the negotiations between 
cultural and personal difference, of the relationship to (patriarchal) authority 
and of the limits of control. That the book is also a self-conscious exercise in intertextuality is, I hope, equally clear: it draws on Herbert's 
<i>Dune </i>and on 
Ursula Le Guin's <i>The Dispossessed </i>as well as Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Bend Sinister</i> 
and the poetry of Robert Browning. I hope, in saying this, that I am only saying 
what is obvious from the novel itself. It remains the bleakest of my books, but 
I continue to find an austere and strangely uplifting beauty in certain aspects 
of bleakness, so I say this with no suggestion of apology.

<p class="aplaintext"><i>Gradisil</i> tells of three generations of a family 
central to the history of the Uplands, a low Earth orbit settlement 
predominantly of the super-rich, from 2059 to 2131. While initially the Uplands 
is an anarchy of sorts, it soon becomes a quasi-republic. Farah Mendlesohn, in
<a href="biblio.htm#Callow & McFarlane">Callow &amp; McFarlane</a>, notes that the 
first part &quot;is a not untypical tale of libertarian colonialism in which rather a 
lot of incorrect assumptions about &#39;how the west was won&#39; are transported into 
space,&quot; which &quot;is a very twentieth-century interpretation of how western 
expansion, or even the founding of America, worked.&quot; &quot;The belief that colonial 
(and other expansionist) enterprises are the actions of individuals resisting 
the state, is a form of institutionalized sociopathy that has infected the 
American body politic and the genre of science fiction.&quot; She also observes, in 
an endnote, that &quot;One political issue I have with most SF, and Roberts&#39;s in 
particular, is that historically communalist societies are better at surviving.&quot;
<i>Gradisil</i> is included in the list of &#39;Stories that explore anarchist

<p class="aplaintext"><i>New Model Army</i> posits a kind of mercenary army, in 
a fracturing near-future UK, that dispenses with feudal hierarchy through moment 
to moment decision-making by wiki: what is put forward as &#39;real democracy&#39;. The 
work is discussed at length by Thomas Wellman, in
<a href="biblio.htm#Callow & McFarlane">Callow &amp; McFarlane</a>, who 
concludes that it &quot;invites us to call two visions of modern Europe into question 
that have become institutionalized in real-life: the narrative of the peaceful 
(and ever closer) union, and the war-inducing concept of the nation-state&quot;, and 
that it is &quot;far from a simple thought experiment conducted in guerrilla warfare, 
but a highly relevant and sceptical treatment of two fundamental principles of 
modernity.&quot; In the same collection of critical essays, a Borgesian piece by Paul 
Graham Raven draws out explicitly the anarchism of the novel, comparing it, as a 
utopia, to Le Guin&#39;s <i>The Dispossessed</i>; he notes that the peer-to-peer 
capabilities of the wiki &quot;allow individuals to circumvent state-dominated media 
and organize effective collective action against the state, and â€“ possibly, as 
Roberts&#39;s slingshot ending implies â€“ transcend to a higher order of collectivity: 
the paradoxical <i>post-geographical </i>state, an atomised collective to whom 
borders are mere fictions, false maps superimposed upon the one, true, free 
territory.&quot; Andrew M. Butler&#39;s essay, immediately following, also notes &quot;the 
anarchistic, leaderless structure&quot; of the eponymous NMA.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote"><strong>KSR</strong> Iâ€™m a statist; I donâ€™t believe 
anarchism is a way to get through the next couple of centuries. I thoroughly 
approve of anarchismâ€™s ultimate goal of the total horizontalisation of power 
but, to me, anarchism is a horizon that is centuries out.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><strong>HF</strong> At least one literary critic has 
coupled your name with Murray Bookchin.</p>
<p class="blockquote"><strong>KSR</strong> Iâ€™ve read Bookchin and I admire his 
work. Iâ€™m thinking more of anarchisms that conflate capitalism and the state. I 
separate them, just as I separate capitalism and science. Iâ€™m also thinking of 
the anti-humanism of certain anarchisms, those that turn into libertarianism 
very easily in an ugly way, those that say it doesnâ€™t matter if six billion 
people die because then weâ€™d have a sustainable number. Whatâ€™s good in anarchism 
is the idea of a complete horizontalisation of power and prosperity. Itâ€™s a 
great long-term horizon to aim for. Itâ€™s like utopia itself. Iâ€™m a utopian, but 
I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m an anarchist because I donâ€™t think a state monopoly on 
violence is a bad thing at this point in history. Itâ€™s better than the 
alternatives, better than chaos, better than the freedom to burn as much carbon 
as I want. I think that carbon use should be legislated and controlled and 
priced, and anarchy doesnâ€™t provide a way of doing that.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">From a 1985 convention report

online</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="blockquote">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="blockquote">Rosenberg said he and Mike McGarry 
are writing a novel, in which all the Earth&#39;s libertarians are dumped on an 
alien planet, and the history of the planet followed for the next 150 years. He 
described it as a thought experimentâ€”but then couldn&#39;t resist telling us how it 
comes out: feudalism. Joel, if you&#39;ve predetermined the conclusion (I remarked), 
it&#39;s not an experiment! One might also question the the wisdom of someone who 
knows so little about a subject writing a book about it. (Rosenberg was 
uncomprehending, even contemptuous of the distinction between the anarchist and 
the limited government libertarian. Most if not all of the Founding Fathers were 
libertarians in the latter sense.)</p>

<p class="aplaintext">Unless the reference is in fact to Rosenberg&#39;s Thousand 
Worlds sequence (1984â€“1990), which according to the
<a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/rosenberg_joel">Encyclopedia of 
Science Fiction</a> features mercantile libertarians, but for which McGarry is 
not also credited, it would appear that this novel never appeared, and is now 
unlikely to, given Rosenberg&#39;s death in 2011.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify" class="aplaintext">For John Pilgrim 
this was a &quot;horrifying

incorporates the novella '<a href="http://www.abelard.org/e-f-russell.htm">. . . And Then There Were None'</a> (1948). The novel follows a Terran re-colonising expedition as it encounters various societies, descended from criminals, health faddists, pacifists, etc. The concluding novella describes the encounter with a world of Gands, highly anti-authoritarian followers of Gandhi; virtually the entire expeditionary force deserts to them. It is probably fair to say that 
'And Then There Were None' was the nearest sf work to an anarchist utopia prior to Le Guin's<i> The Dispossessed</i>, and was praised as such in the pages of <i>Freedom</i> and <i>Anarchy</i> at the time, 
starting with a full-length review at the hands of Arthur Uloth in 1954, under 
the headline &quot;An Anarchist Utopia&quot;. He said that &quot;Like William Morris&#39;s <i>News 
from Nowhere</i> it makes an anarchist society not only attractive, but also 
eminently practical&quot;; this is because &quot;The inhabitants of this libertarian 
planet are not saints, they are ordinary people, and their system works.&quot; (Uloth 1954) 
John Pilgrim in 1963 speculated on &quot;just how much influence this much 
anthologised tale has had in forming the political opinions of the fallout 
generation. &quot; (Pilgrim 1960, 1963; Eagle 1969). NB the work itself never uses the

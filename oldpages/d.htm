		<p class="aplaintext">Although it will be <i>The Watch</i> that is of

		<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Watch </i>is supposedly<i> </i>written in 
the first person by Peter Kropotkin, who has been plucked from his deathbed, 
rejuvenated, into a future in which he has the opportunity to foster 
anarchism once more. The plot is on the weak side, but the writing is first 
rate, and the Kropotkin character thoroughly researched, as is historical 
anarchism itself (with references to more recent figures such as Bookchin and 
Chomsky). Anarchism is integral to the book, and is presented with the utmost 
sympathy. Very readable, and a wonderful introduction to anarchist ideas for 
anyone not familiar with them.</p>

		<p class="aplaintext">For Magpie Killjoy, whose

		<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">David Graeber has

		<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="blockquote">But even that movie begins to fall flat the moment 
		it touches on popular politics. The end, when Bruce and Commissioner 
		Gordon settle on the plan to scapegoat Batman and create a false myth 
		around the martyrdom of Harvey Dent, is nothing short of a confession 
		that politics is identical to the art of fiction. The Joker was right:

		be turned back upon itself.</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">Further,</p>
		<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="blockquote">When&nbsp;<em>Dark Knight</em> came out in 2008, there 
		was much discussion over whether the whole thing was really a vast 
		metaphor for the war on terror: how far is it okay for the good guys 
		(America, obviously) to adapt the bad guy’s methods? The filmmakers 
		managed to respond to these issues and still produce a good movie. This 
		is because the War on Terror actually was a battle of secret networks 
		and manipulative spectacles. It began with a bomb and ended with an 
		assassination. One can almost think of it as an attempt, on both sides, 
		to actually enact a comic book version of the universe.</p>

			as an Anarchist?&#39;:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p class="aplaintext">For AutumnLeavesCascade, &quot;That whole film 
				trilogy contains strong anti-anarchist propaganda, so we ought 
				not trust its depictions of its &quot;anarchists&quot;. Nevertheless, Bane 
				had a bit of the rhetoric and actions, but ultimately his 
				character progression was to make the film&#39;s point that you 
				can&#39;t trust anti-authoritarian resistance to not become 
				tyrannical, it&#39;s the typical bullshit that anarchy results in a 
				backswing of warlordism or totalitarianism.&quot;</p>
				<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="aplaintext">[Deleted] answers the question with:</p>
				<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="blockquote">Not in the slightest bit. Actually I think 
				the movie itself has a contradiction in it that really says a 
				lot about the ideological climate we exist in. </p>
				<p class="blockquote">Nolan was clearly trying tie Bane to 
				Occupy (even just via symbols/terminology) and criticize 
				revolutionary anti-capitalist sentiment in general. The 
				liberation of the prisons, the comments about the &quot;people&#39;s 
				house&quot;, the attacks on cops, all of this is a clear attempt to 
				place Bane in an ideological camp. But here&#39;s where a problem 
				comes in; just labeling them the bad guys isn&#39;t enough for us 
				not to sympathize with them. Its not enough that all the visual 
				indicators of bad (freaky breathing apparatus) are there, 
				there&#39;s a legitimate danger that no matter how many heroic shots 
				of valiant cops there are, there&#39;s a chance that the audience 
				will still cheer for the orphans that didn&#39;t get to grow up with 
				wealth from the arms industry.</p>
				<p class="blockquote">So to ensure we stay with the &quot;right&quot; 
				side, they have to insert a plot about the bomb that otherwise 
				makes no sense at all. Because simply, the defenders of the 
				status quo really can&#39;t be the good guys unless the alternative 
				to the status quo is annihilation.</p>
				<p class="aplaintext">jamieandhisego concludes the Reddit 
				discussion with his own two word answer: &quot;Fuck no.&quot;</p>

paragraph describes Velm&#39;s bureaucratic anarchy <i>as</i> a world government. It 
isn&#39;t really an anarchy in anarchist terms: his definition says that 
&quot;Bureaucratic anarchy means a socialist world government in which small sections 
are always reverting to some form of feudal capitalism for anywhere from a week 
to two years standard—the longest we&#39;ll allow it to last.&quot;</p>

James de Mille: <i>A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder</i> (1888)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">
<i>A Strange Manuscript</i> is a lost-race story, set in Antarctica. In 1969 
George Woodcock discussed the work as a &quot;solitary successful Canadian utopian 
novel&quot; (97), deciding that it is not so much utopia as Butlerian satire: its 
moral vision, &quot;perhaps . . . characteristic of Canada&quot;, he finds to be &quot;that of 
the Middle way—moderation in all things.&quot; (98) In 1980 he found the novel &quot;an 
effective satire on the hypocritical Victorian world&quot; de Mille lived in 
(Woodcock 1980: 24).</p>

<p class="aplaintext">In &#39;The Last of the Masters&#39; Dick took anarchism itself for its explicit theme. Two hundred years after the triumph of the Anarchist
League by overthrowing the world's governments, a pocket state is discovered, ruled by a still-surviving government
robot. An Anarchist League agent destroys the robot. The League itself is a voluntary club of unorganised individuals
whose task it is to patrol the world scotching any attempts to restore government. It is made clear at the end of the
story that, while there are disadvantages to global anarchism, they are more than outweighed by the effective abolition
of war that has followed from its adoption. The tale is included in Dana&#39;s <i>
<a href="#Dana">AnarchoSF V.1</a>. </i>For
<a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/books/the-last-of-the-masters-by-philip-k-dick">
Margaret Killjoy</a> &quot;This story, by my reading, is neither libel nor advocacy, 
just a thought experiment by someone only peripherally versed in anarchism. 
Which frankly doesn’t make it feel all that valuable to the conversation.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Dick&#39;s works constituted for Vittorio Curtoni a &quot;violent 
fresco of social schizophrenia&quot; (25). All his works show a high degree of 
humanity and identification with the underdog.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The three novels of the 1950s are referred to 
by Curtoni as exemplary of his style and concerns. <i>Solar Lottery</i> is 
Dick&#39;s first, in which the top political position is chosen by lot, but subject 
to popularly condoned assassination; a parallel plot concerns a quasi-religious 
quest outside the solar system. The novel was described in
<a href="http://www.arivista.org/index.php?nr=228&pag=228_10.htm&key=solar lottery">
Marzia Rubega</a>&#39;s 1996 article on Dick in <i>A-Rivista Anarchica</i>, and is cited in <i>The BASTARD Chronicles 
2015.</i> In <i>Eye in the Sky</i> an accident in a 
particle accelerator causes a number of individuals to live successively through 
each other&#39;s versions of the normal world, none of which is particularly normal. 
In <i>Time Out of Joint</i> the central character believes he is living in the 
1950s, as a competition expert; in reality he is living in the 1990s, helping 
plan the bombing of the moon; his fantasy is a withdrawal psychosis, the only 
way he can continue this work, having been converted to the &#39;lunatic&#39; cause.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The society of <i>Galactic Pot-Healer</i> has 
been described as &quot;the ultimate Communist denial of personal consciousness.&quot; (<a href="http://mises.org/daily/5089">Riggenbach</a>)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Man in the High Castle, Ubik, </i>and
<i>Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said</i>, among Dick&#39;s best, are listed in 
Curtoni&#39;s essential bibliography, but not discussed by him. <i>The Man in the 
High Castle</i> is a complex alternate history of America after losing World War 
II, set in the Japanese Pacific States of America; it is a superb sf classic, 
high on compassion and having much to say, indirectly, about power 
relationships. <i>Ubik</i> recounts the involuted existences of a group of 
people living in &#39;half-life&#39; after being killed by a bomb on the moon; in many 
ways similar to <i>Eye in the Sky</i>, it has perhaps been overrated, though
<a href="http://www.arivista.org/index.php?nr=228&pag=228_10.htm&key=solar lottery">
Rubega</a> describes it as both &quot;fascinating&quot; and a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Reality is 
out of joint for the protagonist of <i>Flow My Tears</i>, who finds himself 
briefly living in an alternate world created by another character&#39;s drug trip; 
the figure of Police General Buckman, although disagreeable, is presented as 
human—there are no human baddies, for such antagonist as may be discerned is the 
abstract one of drugs-as-control. For

is cited in <i>The BASTARD Chronicles 2015, </i>as is <i>The Three Stigmata of

<p class="aplaintext">In <i>Counter-Clock World</i> a black

<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Zap Gun</i> depicts an America divided 
between those who believe the government is protecting them with ever more 
elaborate weaponry and those who know that none of the weaponry works, except in 
simulations; both parties are in on the fraud, which they perpetrate in order to 
prop up a permanent Cold War economy. (<a href="http://mises.org/daily/5089">Riggenbach</a>)</p>

clear moral is that &quot;It does not matter if power if justifiable on some level. 
It is nonetheless, sociopathic.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">A 
proponent of governmental decentralisation and opponent of organised religion, 
it is perhaps unfortunate that some of Dick's later, delusional, work has had a 
posthumous influence in the emergence of anarcho-gnostics. Among these later

<p class="aplaintext">Vittorio Curtoni, writing in 1978, considered <i>Camp 
Concentration</i> to be &quot;very fine&quot;. It concerns the experimental 
treatment of American concentration-camp inmates with a syphilis-derived drug 
which enhances intelligence but accelerates death.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&#39;Mutability&#39; is set in the free university city of T&uuml;bingen at the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. T&uuml;bingen is said to have been declared a free city by the UN in 
2039, after the faculty and students of the university had spearheaded the pan-Germanic Anarchist movement. It is said to have a uniquely democratic
government, but American observers seem to be unimpressed.</p>

		<p class="aplaintext">In the strongly feminist <i>Alanya to Alanya </i>
Earth women, including some anarchists, are actively supported by the Marq&#39;ssan 
aliens, who, with technological superiority on their side, vigorously promote 
&quot;non-authoritarian self-governance&quot;. <i>Blood in the Fruit</i> 
includes a sequence in which the North West Free Zone celebrates Emma Goldman 
Day; three Goldman quotations serve as epigraph to the novel, and the front 
cover features a photograph of Goldman speaking in Union Square, at Duchamp&#39;s 
own suggestion—she has said that &quot;Most of the Free Zone activists are 
working-class women who embrace a philosophy of life and politics very close to 
Goldman&#39;s . . .&quot;.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><b>SM:</b> So anarchism, or negotiation, is possible not 
only on a small scale but also a large scale?</p>
<p class="blockquote"><b>LTD:</b> Yes, I believe it is. But it would require 
major changes in our educational system, in the distribution of information, and 
in how we live as active, responsible subjects in the world. It would require, 
in short, that as a species, we mature and leave childhood behind (i.e., that we 
metaphorically speaking develop the part of our pre-frontal cortex that is able 
to see past the moment and think beyond impulse, as the medical literature tells 
us happens when individuals mature into adults).</p>

by Sean Melican</a>]</p>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Marq&#39;ssan Cycle</i> as a whole is a significant 
work, looking at relationships of power at many levels, especially the 
interpersonal. Duchamp has said:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">I wanted this to be a story charting an on-going process 
of change, not one in which a tabula-rasa utopia is created in the wake of an 
apocalypse allowing everyone to &quot;start over&quot; without significant institutional 
baggage. In the course of writing the first novel, I soon realized that getting 
rid of a repressive regime is the easy part. The characters in these books are 
as resistant to changing ingrained patterns of political and social behavior as 
any living person is. Which is why the series spans two decades and comprises 
five long novels.&nbsp; </p>

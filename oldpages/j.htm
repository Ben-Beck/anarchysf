<h3>Shelley Jackson: <i>Half Life</i> (2006)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Atomic bomb testing has resulted in a significant 
sub-population of conjoined twins, mostly sharing a body but with two heads; the 
first-person narrative is by one/two such twins. Imaginative and surreal.</p>

Joan Haran</a> this &quot;brilliant&quot; novel makes imaginative use of the unreliable 
narrator, and &quot;teaches you to read critically&quot; about both fiction and 
non-fiction.</p>

<h3>Malcolm Jameson: <i>'</i>The Anarch' (1944)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Published 
in <i>Astounding</i> in 1944, this concerns a rebel against a future 
totalitarian autarchy, who strikes a deal with the Autarch under which his own 
role is formalised as the Anarch, acting as antithesis. Out of their engagement 
a new democracy is born, based on representative democracy. The Autarch decides 
to run for President. The only real ideological base is classical liberalism, 
with Mill&#39;s <i>On Liberty</i> cited explicitly.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Richard Jefferies: <i>After London</i> (1885)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">For Arthur Uloth, &quot;This strange book has not the 
compulsive power of <i>1984</i>. Yet it wears better than many other prophecies, 
and could still come true.&quot; A post-holocaust novel, for Uloth &quot;. . . the 
sub-medieval society Jefferies describes could still come into being, indeed it 
is the most likely sort of society to do so after an atomic war, unless all life 
were obliterated.&quot; (Uloth 1963: 380)</p>

<h3>N.K. Jemisin: <i>The Fifth Season</i> (2015)</h3>

<h3>
David Glyn Jones: <i>The Machine</i> (2010)</h3>
<p class="blockquote">
			Blurb: There is only THE MACHINE and those who live within it. Told through the 
unconventional, simple language of blue 7, one of the millions of workers who 
scurry through its metallic entrails, THE MACHINE tells of a brutal regime and 
the beginnings of rebellion within . . .<br>
Working without purpose and without end, humanity lives and slaves to maintain 
the huge mechanical leviathan, beyond which there is nothing. Blue 7 has spent 
his lifetime working and wondering the function of THE MACHINE, but someone has 
noticed him, and slowly his world begins to unravel in a bloodsoaked violent 
struggle that threatens not only him, but THE MACHINE itself.
A sharp anarchist critique of the modern world devoid of imagination and 
freedom, THE MACHINE pierces through the thin surface of western capitalism, and 
asks difficult questions of modernity.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
This blurb describes <i>The Machine</i> pretty well, but doesn&#39;t capture its 
relentlessly dark and Kafkaesque desperation.</p>

Gwyneth Jones:<i> White Queen</i> (1991);<i> </i>'2020: I AM AN ANARCHIST'

intelligent and complex account of first contact. Mark Bould&#39;s

&quot;Ironic green-socialist-feminist-postcolonial revision of the alien invasion 
narrative.&quot; Included in the

<p class="aplaintext">&#39;2020&#39; is a rather gross (unless you&#39;re a coprophile) near-future 
story, so far only ever published in Farah Mendlesohn, ed.: <i>Glorifying 
Terrorism, </i>an anthology written in deliberate defiance of the UK 
government&#39;s Terrorism Act 2006 banning all &quot;glorification of terrorism&quot;. The

<h3>
(Lyman) (Spicer) Vincent Judson: <i>Solution PNC and PNCland</i> (1973)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">
This obscure and unjustly neglected work is the most comprehensively thought-out 
utopia I can recall reading. &#39;PNC&#39; stands for &#39;Pseudo-Nation Corporation&#39;, 
Judson&#39;s premise being that the nation-state is obsolete and, in his words, &quot;A 
corporation can do anything a government can do—and better&quot;. There is no 
government as such, but all aspects of life are nevertheless subject to 
comprehensive regulation. PNC is a benign meritocratic technocracy, with real sf 
elements (futuristic technology, and even alien contact). The book itself is 
presented as if it were the Corporation&#39;s official <i>Report</i>, as presented 
by its Chairman and CEO. Though on the face of it unattractive, there are real 
freedoms within PNC, and the idealistic author is at pains to point out that PNC 
favours <i>intangible</i> profits (&quot;serving the good of mankind and the 
betterment of the individual&quot;) over tangible profits such as hard cash or barter 
commodities. Anarchists are unlikely to be won over, but this is definitely 
worth reading, and the prevailing optimism is surprisingly beguiling. </p>

<h3>
<img border="0" src="covers/jurassicworld.jpg" width="32" height="44"> <i>
Jurassic World</i> (2015, dir. Colin Trevorrow)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">
Fourth in the <i>Jurassic Park</i> franchise. The dinosaur theme park descends 
into chaos when a genetically engineered ahistorical dinosaur (the &#39;<i>Indominus 
rex</i>&#39;) breaks loose and goes on a rampage across the island.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
The film is subject to a flippant
<a href="http://www.anarchogeekreview.com/movies/jurassic-world-2015#more-781">
review</a> by Gutter Punk Josh at the Anarcho-Geek Review, which concludes &quot;God 
I fucking love dinosaurs. 5/5 would watch again.&quot; Contrariwise it is also held 
up by <a href="https://mises.org/library/jurassic-world-dont-blame-it-market">
Mark Tovey</a> of the Mises Institute (with perhaps po-faced satiric intent—but 
perhaps not) as an allegory of how even market forces can get things wrong, in 
comparison with a hypothetical government-run dinosaur park, concluding that: </p>
<p class="aplaintext">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">Jurassic World’s operators made an &#39;entrepreneurial 
error,&#39; an attempt at profit-making gone awry. The balance between safety and 
wow-factor was ill-struck, and by no means profit-maximizing — Jurassic World 
will lose many, many prospective guests as a result of the <em>Indominus Rex</em> 
debacle.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Importantly, the <em>Indominus Rex</em> must not be held 
against the market <em>per se</em>; we should assess the market not on the basis 
of individual case studies but rather by the equilibria it inspires. Non-optimal 
outcomes <em>do</em> occur on the market’s watch, but in spite of (and not 
because of) its carrot-and-stick regime. The market institutionalizes optimal 
outcomes; without profit and loss, optimal outcomes could come about only by a 
fluke.</p>

<h3>S.F.: 'Through the 'A' in Anarchism' (1956)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">This short tale was published in <i>Freedom</i> in 1956. The narrator day-dreams, at Speakers' Corner, that he sails through
the 'A' on an anarchist banner into the future anarchist world, which is fully described. Britain is now basically running
on anarchist-communist lines. Curiously, though, there is still a need for a police force, though this is all right because
they are all qualified in sociology, psychology, local history and orgone therapy.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The story's gently satiric humour has considerable charm; and the notion that the British only got round to having a
revolution after their supply of tea ran out is perhaps as plausible as many another scenario for revolution here.</p>

Fahrenheit 451 </i>(1966, dir. François Truffaut)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Based on the Bradbury novel of the same name, the film 
takes place in a dystopian future in which a fireman, whose duty it is not to 
extinguish fires but to burn books, takes to reading and rebels against the 
regime.</p>

(1964, dir. Sidney Lumet)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Cold War tension between the USSR and the USA leads to an 
accidental nuclear attack on Moscow, with devastating consequences for both 
countries. A similar story line to <i><a href="d.htm#Dr Strangelove">Dr

<h3>Philip José Farmer: <i>The Lovers</i> (1951/1961/1979); <i>Strange Relations</i> 
(1960)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Vittorio Curtoni refers the reader to these &quot;stories of 
sensual liberation&quot; by Farmer.<i> The Lovers, </i>with<i> </i>its story of 
forbidden love between a future human and a humanoid alien insect parasite, 
broke new ground in sf when it first appeared. <i>Strange Relations</i> is a 
collection of five stories all named for family relationships; most of them 
feature bizarre alien sexuality. The best is &#39;Mother&#39; (1953) (Curtoni: 25).</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Claude Farrère: <i>Useless Hands</i> (1926; first published as <i>Les 
condamnés à mort,</i> 1920)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Dark tale of workers rebelling against a monopolistic 
plutocrat, first through sabotage, then through strike action; but their efforts 
are defeated by the rapid introduction of automation, and their revolt is 
brutally put down by their bosses with a disintegrator ray which kills them in 
their hundreds of thousands. The failed uprising is led by the charismatic head 
of the Council of the Order of Anarchy, but as so often anarchism is just a boo 
word. The anarchists and the bosses are both unsympathetic, and the proletarian 
&#39;useless hands&#39; are no more than ciphers.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Included in Miéville&#39;s Fifty Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction 
Works That Socialists Should Read (as copied to the Anarchy-SF mailing list),

interesting book.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Fawcett"></a>E. Douglas Fawcett: <i>
Hartmann the Anarchist</i> (1893)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In 1920 Hartmann, having invented a tough, light metal, 
launches his aeronef the <i>Attila</i> and mounts a raid on London. His object, 
he says, is &quot;to wreck civilization . . . We are Rousseaus who advocate a return 
to a simpler life . . . We want no more &#39;systems,&#39; or &#39;constitutions&#39;—we shall 
have anarchy.&quot; (Tangent edn: 83-4) Parliament, the Bank of England, the Stock 
Exchange and St Paul&#39;s are destroyed, and the crew of the <i>Attila</i> use 
flamethrowers on the crowds in Farringdon St. However, less than a fifth of 
London is destroyed, Hartmann hears no news of similar risings overseas, and on 
learning that he has killed his own mother he blows up the <i>Attila</i>, with 
himself and all on board. Order is restored, and the Empire recovers.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Although not the first story of this kind,<i> 
Hartmann the Anarchist</i> is the first<i> </i>to identify the terrorists as
anarchists. Superior to most of its successors, it is still fresh, and probably the only one still worth reading.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Weir (2011) describes it as &quot;frankly anti-anarchist&quot;. Pedelty (2011) considers 
it a &quot;very silly story&quot;, but &quot;Not silly-funny [ . . . ] but silly-toxic.&quot; (Pedelty: 
73)</p>

<i>The Final Programme</i> (1973, dir. Robert Fuest; aka <i>The Last Days of Man

<p class="aplaintext">Based on the novel of the same name by the prolific

<p class="aplaintext">Bright and optimistic anthology, which has been seen as 
one of the founding anthologies of solarpunk.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">First drawn to the attention of the Facebook Anarchism and 
Science Fiction Forum in 2014, with the comment &quot;Not sure how much in here is in 
the anarchist spirit, but looks promising that there could be .....&quot; In fact 
there isn&#39;t, really, but it&#39;s still worth reading.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Reviewed by Zeke Teflon, for whom it was only partially 
successful: &quot;Of the 16 stories and one novella, I enjoyed only the six pieces 
mentioned above, disliked about an equal number, and was indifferent to the 
rest.&quot; But for him the last but one story, Charlie Jane Anders&#39;s &#39;The Day It All 
Ended,&#39; tipped the scales, so that the anthology as a whole was recommended.</p>

<h3><img border="0" src="covers/firefly.jpg" width="32" height="44"> <i>Firefly</i> 
(2002/2003, dir. Joss Whedon; single TV series of 14 episodes)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">Space western set in 2517, featuring the activities—licit 
and illicit—of the motley crew of a &#39;Firefly-class&#39; spaceship, in a star system 
controlled by the Alliance, apparently a fusion of the two surviving 
superpowers, the USA and China.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">According to
<a href="http://lfs.org/newsletter/029/04/Somin.shtml">Ilya Somin</a>, of the 
Libertarian Futurist Society, Whedon &quot;deliberately incorporated libertarian 
themes in his 2002 science fiction series <em>Firefly</em>.&quot;
<a href="http://praxeology.net/unblog05-05.htm#04">Roderick Long</a>, too, says 
&quot;The show also has a strong, albeit implicit, libertarian edge to it.&quot;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Most usefully, though, a recent Revolutionary Left Radio
<a href="http://revolutionaryleftradio.libsyn.com/interpreting-firefly-libertarianism-vs-anarchism-w-dr-james-rocha">
podcast</a> features a long interview with Dr James Rocha, on &#39;Interpreting <i>
Firefly</i>: Libertarianism vs Anarchism&#39;. Rocha had authored a paper entitled 
&#39;The Black Reaching Out: An Anarchist Analysis of <i>Firefly</i>&#39; in which he 
argues for an anarchist interpretation of the show over the more prevalent 
right-libertarian interpretation. Though Rocha&#39;s paper doesn&#39;t seem to be 
accessible on the Internet, in the interview Rocha argues that <i>Firefly</i> 
should actually be seen as an anarchist critique of right-libertarianism, in 
which the initial fairly pronounced libertarian sentiments of the spaceship&#39;s 
captain are progressively rejected as the series goes on in favour of a more 
anarchist perspective.</p>

<h3>Homer Eon Flint: <i>
<a href="http://purple.home.texas.net/etexts/QueenOfLife/default.html">The Queen of Life</a> </i>(1919)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">In <i>The Queen of Life </i>the humanoid inhabitants of Venus have encased the planet in an 
alarmingly sterile glass 
sphere, and vanquished scarcity many generations in the past, entirely 
eliminating conflict and with it any concepts of nationhood, the state, and 
government itself. This curiosity has the flavour of the true utopia about it, 
yet as sf it withholds the utopian possibility. Flint seems unusually ambivalent 
about his authorial intent, presumably the consequence of editorial 
intervention.</p>

<h3>
E.M. Forster: &#39;The Machine Stops&#39; (1909)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext">
An early dystopia, in which Earth&#39;s future population, now living underground, 
has become slave to, and is beginning to worship, the Machine; a rebel discovers 
freedom above ground, but although those already living free survive, he is not 
spared when society collapses on the breakdown of the Machine.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">
George Woodcock found this the most interesting early anti-Utopia, with its 
&quot;strong element of neo-Luddism&quot;. He felt it lacked immediacy, though, saying it 
&quot;pays scanty attention to its social and political implications&quot;. (Woodcock 
1956) For Ursula K. Le Guin this was &quot;the first and finest&quot; of the satirical 
utopias in which robots do the work and humans sit back and play (Le Guin 1982).

<h3>Charles Fourier:<i> The Theory of the Four Movements </i>(1808); <i>The 
Utopian Vision of Charles Fourier. Selected texts on work, love and passionate 
attraction</i> (1971, ed. Jonathan Beecher &amp; Richard Bienvenu)</h3>
<p class="aplaintext"><i>The Theory of the Four Movements</i> is an extraordinary work of early libertarian socialism, a 
mix of a penetrating critique of developing capitalism and a fanciful 
quasi-prophetic visionary cosmogony. The fullest anarchist discussion is 
probably that by Don LaCoss, originally published in <i>Fifth Estate</i> in 
2003, and now available at
<a href="mailto:https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/don-lacoss-charles-fourier-prefigures-our-total-refusal">
The Anarchist Library</a>. LaCoss gives an accurate summary of this work:</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquote">This scheme for a revolutionary reorganization of life on 
all planes of existence was the subject of his wonderfully weird first book, 
Theory of the Four Movements (1808), which might be best characterized as a 
combination of philosophy, cosmogony, industrial psychology, science fiction, 
and prophecy. In the pages of this great utopian text, Fourier vigorously 
condemned capitalist markets, bureaucratic excrescence, the oppression of women, 
and suffocation of desire by the leviathans of industrial civilization.</p>
<p class="blockquote">To address these wrongs, he proposed a complex system of 
worker self-management, locally autonomous voluntary associations, and the 
restoration of existential meaning to daily chores. The goal of this system was 
“universal harmony,” a near-hallucinatory level of sensual creation and 
gratification that would emerge from intentional communities. The paths toward 
Harmony would inevitably lead to the evolutionary overcoming of industrial 
capitalism: animals would learn to play musical instruments, stars will copulate 
and spray us all with their sexual fluids, weather patterns will shift, new 
moons will revolve around the earth, the chemical composition of the oceans 
would change, and human bodies begin to mutate. </p>
<p class="blockquote">I suspect that Fourier may not have intended that people 
read his Theory of the Four Movements as literal, instrumental prescriptions for 
social change. What his book did offer, however, was a glimpse of what unleashed 
passion and imagination could produce if you refused to let your mind be limited 
by the existing orders of knowledge and institutions of power.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">To be honest, parts of the book come across as pretty 
demented, but the strength of the rest sustains the reader&#39;s interest.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The <i>Utopian Vision</i> anthology is definitely of 
interest. Fourier&#39;s vision is really rather remarkable, and though by no means 
conventionally utopian the future tense in which much of it is written, and the 
occasional vignettes of life in his ideal society, mark it as in a sense science 
fictional. Though in many ways rigidly regimented on pseudo-scientific lines, 
the utopian society is depicted as joyously socialistic, antipathetic to the 
work ethic, and glorying in free-range sexuality.</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">Max <a href="biblio.htm#Nettlau short history">Nettlau</a> 
was clear on Fourier&#39;s importance: &quot;In short, we can say that many roads led 
from Fourierism to libertarian socialism&quot; . . . .</p>

<p class="aplaintext">&quot;Governments and corporations wage war against anarchist enclaves.&quot; (Dan Clore)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The dense 
text and opacity of the storyline tend to dilute such interest as the reader 
might have in the self-contained enclaves, which are more outlaw than anarchist, 
notwithstanding a passing nod in the direction of Kropotkin.</p>

<p class="aplaintext">
The last quarter of
<i> 
The White Stone</I> recounts a dream of a 23<sup><font face="Verdana">rd</font></sup> 
century collectivist utopia in a federal Europe; there remains a strong 
anarchist opposition, which is generally tolerated. For Marie-Louise Berneri &quot;Anatole 
France&#39;s utopian sketch in <i>La Pierre Blanche</i> has been rightly ignored, as 
it is one of his dullest pieces of writing&quot; . . . (Berneri 1949: 293)</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;<p class="aplaintext"><i> Penguin Island </i>is 
a satire involving evolution among penguins. Book Two presents an essentially anarchist view of the origin of property
and government:<blockquote>
	<p class="aplaintext">&quot;Do you see, my son,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;that madman who with his teeth is biting the nose of the adversary he has overthrown and that other one who is pounding a woman&#39;s head with a huge stone?&quot;</p>
	<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="aplaintext">
	</p>
<p class="aplaintext">&quot;I see them,&quot; said Bulloch. &quot;They are creating law; they are founding property; they are establishing the principles of civilization, the basis of society, and the foundations of the State.&quot; </blockquote>
<p class="aplaintext">(Bantam Classic edn: 37)</p>
<p class="aplaintext"></p>
<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aplaintext">The last book concerns the future destruction of civilization, initiated by anarchist bombers; although the author seems to have some sympathy for this, the book concludes with the cyclical return of the triumphant State. Unusually, we have a record of the views of Bartolomeo Vanzetti on this work: for him 
&quot;France masterly slaps, in this book, the pretentions, proudness, hypocracy, stupidity and ferocity of the humane, and shows the uselessness of religions, and the venom of the clergies.&quot; (Frankfurter &amp; Jackson, eds: 144)</p>

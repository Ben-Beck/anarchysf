			<h3>Herbert Read</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;To pass to more 
			sophisticated types of Fantasy, written as deliberate artifices, it 
			is easy to quote many quasi-fantastical compositions, but very few 
			have the purity of traditional fairy tales. A &#39;Utopia&#39;, or 
			description of a fantastical country and its civilization, might 
			well exhibit all the characteristics of pure Fantasy, but rarely 
			does so because the writer has some ulterior satirical or moral aim, 
			which aim directs his composition, fixes it in space and time, gives 
			it a basis of subjective intolerance. Such objections apply to <i>
			Utopia</i> itself, to <i>News from Nowhere</i> and <i>The Dream of 
			John Ball</i>, to <i>Erewhon</i> and <i>A Crystal Age</i>. They do 
			not apply to some of the fantasies of H.G. Wells, who comes as near 
			as any modern writer to a sense of pure Fantasy. He errs, as in <i>
			The Time Machine</i>, by imparting to his fantasies a 
			pseudo-scientific logicality; it is as though having conceived one 
			arbitrary fantasy he were compelled by the habits of his scientific 
			training to work out the consequences of this fantasy. Real fantasy 
			is bolder than this; it dispenses with all logic and habit, and 
			relies on the force of wonder alone.&quot;</p>

			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: right">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: right">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;It must be 
			admitted that left to itself to imagine an ideal state of existence, 
			the human mind betrays a distressing tendency towards 
			authoritarianism. This is not a result, as Dr. Popper might argue, 
			of irresponsibility, but precisely of that rationalizing faculty 
			which he so much admires. There exists in the human mind, 
			particularly in the mind of the scientist, an itch for tidiness, for 
			symmetry, and formality. This leads to good results in purely mental 
			categories, and to it we owe the achievements of logic and 
			scientific method. But life itself is not tidy and cannot be made 
			tidy so long as it is life. It is always spontaneous in its 
			manifestations, unpredictable in its blind drive to the light. Most 
			Utopians forget or ignore this fact, and as a result their ideal 
			commonwealth can never be, or ought never to become, real.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;For 
			totalitarianism is nothing but the imposition of a rational 
			framework on the organic freedom of life, and is more characteristic 
			of the scientific mind than of the poetic mind. It is only in those 
			writers who retain a sense of organic freedom—Rabelais, Diderot, and 
			Morris—that the Utopia is in any sense libertarian. It is no strange 
			coincidence that these are the only inspiring utopias.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;If the 
			realization of a rational blue-print leads to the death of society 
			(a process which I have described symbolically in <i>The Green Child</i>), 
			this does not mean that the utopian mentality itself is necessarily 
			baneful—on the contrary, utopianism, as Anatole France said, is the 
			principle of all progress. It is the poeticization of all 
			practicalities, the idealization of everyday activities. It is not a 
			rational process: it is an imaginative process. The Utopia fades the 
			moment we attempt to actualize it. But it is necessary; it is even a 
			biological necessity, an antidote to societal lethargy. Society 
			exists to transcend itself, and the progressive force of its 
			evolution is the poetic imagination, the teleological instinct that 
			moves with the organic principle of all evolution, to take 
			possession of new forms of life, new fields of consciousness.&quot;</p>

			<h3><b>Alex Comfort</b></h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;I do not decry fantasy as a genre, only 
			fantasy which is made an excuse for irresponsibility or 
			non-responsibility, a failure to grasp the real world, and an easy 
			escape into an arbitrary one. That is not the fantasy of writers 
			like Kafka, who went through purgatory in writing it, or fantasy 
			like Read&#39;s <i>Green Child</i>, or <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, or, 
			on another level, <i>Candide</i>, nor the fantasy of a talented 
			psychopath like de Sade.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: right">(<i>The Novel and 
			Our Time</i>, 1948)</p>
			<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">. . . &quot;the most frightening risk is that the 
			fantastic-realistic genre of the future will go on being written in 
			actual events, not ink, by deranged people who are enacting fantasy, 
			instead of discharging it in literature.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The characteristically modern genre of 
			fantastic is, I suppose, science fiction. This was originally no 
			more than an imaginative forecast of the possibilities of science, 
			but it has been captured by its literary ancestors in the same 
			manner as the non-scientific romance, the erotic comic. At one 
			extreme, it is not very different from that, with jargon playing the 
			part of magic in pre-industrial fantasy, space travel as an exotic 
			setting, and the mad scientist, who is a compound of Prometheus and 
			Faust, playing the part of the wizard: one, that is, etymologically, 
			contemptible for his addition to knowledge, as a drunkard is one 
			contemptible for his addiction to drink, or a sluggard to sleep. At 
			the other, it has become the vehicle through which more than one 
			scientist who is not mad has tried to draw attention to the social 
			activities of non-scientists who are.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;There is no room here to pursue the ancestry 
			of Utopias and of science fantasy turned satire [ . . . ], but it 
			stands in the same relation to comic-book science as Candide does to 
			comic-book romance: both owe their sting to the convergence between 
			fantasy and history. Just as Mirbeau and Kafka now sound 
			unpleasantly factual, it is hard to tell whether some of the 
			fantasies of science fiction are paranoiac or merely satirical&quot; . .

			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">. . . &quot;the 
			resurgence of revivalist religion and the vast popularity of the 
			otherworldly fantasies of science fiction writers are phenomena 
			which suggest that men like Wells and Koestler are the intellectual 
			spokesmen of a widespread feeling that, for man as he is, progress 
			has come to an end and only the realm of miracles can offer a 
			solution to his dilemmas.&quot;</p>

			<h3>Arthur Uloth</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;It is tempting to 
			say that science fiction resembles Christianity, in that it has died 
			with its founder. Certainly, judging by this book, there are few who 
			come up to Wells&#39; standard. Few indeed who are likely to be 
			remembered and read as long as he.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Mr. Amis includes 
			&quot;1984&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; as science fiction, but it is 
			difficult to see on what grounds, unless it is a desire to raise the 
			general standard. A science fiction story must surely revolve around 
			some discovery or invention, some unprecedented change in nature, or 
			at least take place on, or bear a direct relation to some other 
			planet, or some world other than ours. Otherwise almost any book 
			should be counted as science fiction. [ . . . ] One cannot escape a 
			feeling that these stores are included as &quot;makeweights&quot;. Most of the 
			rest is pretty light-weight stuff.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The trouble is 
			that science fiction is a form of specialised addict-literature. It 
			is on the same level as the Western and the detective story. Wells 
			could give it that universal appeal, which raises a story above the 
			level of addict-literature, but his successors do not, in the main, 
			succeed in doing this.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Of course there 
			is a good deal of variety. Some of the stories are trashy, and the 
			author gives us, as he is bound to do if he is to survey the whole 
			field, a fair number of examples of tripe, sadism and would-be Poe. 
			In these latter cases the story may well cease to be &quot;Science 
			fantasy&quot; and become &quot;fantasy&quot;, simple if not pure.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Not all the 
			stories are horrific. Some are gentle, some humorous, some (not 
			mentioned in this book) are anarchistic. But the appeal of most of 
			these tales is to a curiously limited outlook, which is masculine, 
			mechanically-minded, rationalist, democratic and puritan. It is an 
			outlook which does not attract me much, but it is preferable to 
			religious mysticism, aristocracy and tyranny, although some tales 
			which tend this way also exist.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Sex scarcely 
			raises its ugly head, except if you count some of the sadistic 
			&quot;fantasy&quot; stories. Women are treated superficially. (Though there 
			are some women writers in this field they appear to be in a 
			minority). Future societies are not all horrible tyrannies, but when 
			the science fiction writer has to construct a utopia all that 
			emerges is a society &quot;with more decency and less television&quot;. 
			Generally we are not told how this desirable society has been 
			brought about.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">Although the usual 
			moral of these stories is that the individual must fight against all 
			efforts to crush him, and that freedom is the desirable goal, there 
			is very little real radical thought. We are not told how to improve 
			conditions, only how to resist tyranny. This is inadequate. It is 
			curious that people who are able to imagine the most fantastic 
			worlds, creatures, machines, spaceships, flaws in the structure of 
			the cosmos itself, are unable to conceive of social and sexual 
			changes. No doubt this is partly due to the fact that the writers 
			hope to have their work published without too much trouble! After 
			all, science fiction, like many other things, is a commercial 
			enterprise, not an effort to reform the world. But it may also be 
			that the kind of person who is attracted to this kind of literature 
			is the kind who is not disposed to think about the problems of 
			sexual relations, and so forth. I wonder.&quot;</p>

			Survey,&#39; 1961)</p>
			<h3>John Pilgrim</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Mention science 
			fiction to an anarchist and much the same reaction is provoked as 
			mentioning anarchism to a layman. The former thinks of Bug Eyed 
			Monsters and half naked nubile young women in the clutch of flying 
			dinosaurs, and the latter gets a Chestertonian vision of a cloaked 
			and bearded figure carrying a spherical object marked &quot;BOMB&quot;. In 
			neither case does the public image bear much relationship to the 
			reality. As I first made contact with anarchist ideas through 
			science fiction short stories the following article is an attempt to 
			explain why I feel that this medium is of great value to the 
			dissemination of anarchist ideas, and why I think anarchist writers 
			should attempt to write such fiction.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Science fiction 
			magazines are the only popular media that as a matter of course 
			present ideas that the upholder of the present <i>status quo</i> 
			would regard as subversive. It is no accident that many of the best 
			writers in the field hold ideas that the parliamentarian would 
			regard as dangerously progressive. They hold these views because the 
			very nature of science fiction compels the writer, and therefore the 
			reader, to examine what is wrong with society, where humanity went 
			off the rails, what the present political systems are leading to. 
			Continually the themes occur of the fight for individual freedom and 
			dignity against totalitarianism, against welfare states gone off the 
			rails, and of the dangerous tendency of the majority of humankind to 
			accept that what they are told is good for them.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;An article 
			printed in FREEDOM is preaching to the converted. If anarchist 
			writers are anxious to spread anarchist ideas among the general 
			public, if they are anxious to DO something other than sink pints of 
			bitter in the &quot;Marquis of Granby&quot; and deplore public apathy, then 
			may I suggest they turn to the science fiction field. When people 
			have assimilated anarchist ideas in their light reading they will be 
			much more likely to listen to the next anarchist speaker they hear, 
			or read the next anarchist writer they come across. The idea of a 
			really free society will no longer seem so alien.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">. . . &quot;the fact 
			that many writers and readers of science fiction have ideas on these 
			subjects that would not be despised by anarchists seems to show that 
			the thinking is to some purpose. I believe that the world is a 
			slightly better place, the prospect before us just as slightly more 
			hopeful, and a free society a fraction nearer, because of it.</p>

			<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;I would therefore only claim that the 
			conclusions I reached, and the overwhelmingly libertarian tendency 
			that I observed in science fiction is valid up to that date [1960].&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">. . . &quot;I realised there was already in 
			existence a literary form, which was, if not anarchist, at least 
			consistently liberal and anti-authoritarian in its social views, and 
			that was science fiction.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;As late as 1960 most of the anarchists I met 
			felt that science fiction was beneath their notice.&nbsp; The 
			general picture of the medium seemed to be that of a half naked 
			nubile young woman seized in the claws of a flying dinosaur while 
			the Errol Flynn of the spaceways attempted simultaneously to rescue 
			her and fight off a colony of giant intelligent ants. Now this 
			picture of science fiction bears as much relation to the bulk of the 
			medium as does the Chestertonian vision of the anarchist as a 
			cloaked and bearded figure carrying spherical &quot;bomb&quot; does to the 
			editor of this periodical. In neither case does the public image 
			bear much relationship to the reality.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;As far as the general public is concerned 
			science fiction magazines are the only form of popular fiction that,
			<i>as a matter of course</i>, present ideas that the supporter of 
			the <i>status quo </i>would regard as subversive.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;One of the basic premises of science fiction, 
			not so common in mainstream fiction, is that established laws, 
			customs, morals and taboos, are not constants, not all time truths, 
			but part of a planetary culture that may be good or bad, but whose 
			value must be assessed in terms of that culture&#39;s ability to give 
			the individuals who comprise it the freedom to develop themselves to 
			the full extent of their capabilities.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;It is no accident that the science fiction 
			magazines continually portray ideas that the average establishment 
			man would regard as dangerously progressive. It is because <i>the 
			very nature of</i> science fiction compels the writer, and therefore 
			the reader, to examine what is wrong with society, where humanity 
			went off the rails, and what the present political systems are 
			leading to.&quot;</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;A major virtue of science fiction is that 
			even where no progressive or anarchist ideas are advanced, moral 
			questions are discussed in a manner quite unheard of in the 
			equivalent outlets for mainstream fiction.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Thus although science fiction stories on the 
			simplest lever of appreciation can be regarded as fairy tales they 
			differ from conventional fairy tales, (to paraphrase the doyen of 
			the genre Edmund Crispin) in carrying a massive load of religious, 
			political, ethical and sociological implication and so provide 
			intellectual stimulation of a kind not met with in contemporary 
			fiction. The critical examination of humanity and its institutions 
			that plays so large a part in the medium could be considered 
			destructive in that dilemmas and problems are pointed out far more 
			often than solutions are suggested, but writers are not social 
			engineers, and it is enough that, as the stupidities and crudities 
			of human governments and their pernicious effect on individuality 
			are presented, science fiction gives to many people their first 
			glimpse of what is wrong with our society. This is what really 
			matters: in an age when all the pressure is on non-thinking 
			conformity, science fiction enlivens and provokes the intellect, and 
			strikes a blow for free creative thought at the cultural 
			necrophiliacs who have dominated our culture and stultified our 
			universities since the Renaissance started the educational vogue for 
			feeding on the decaying corpses and doubtful virtues of dead 
			cultures.&quot;</p>

			could undertake would be the development of a utopian novel that 
			presents an anarchist society. In the past such novels have gained 
			widespread popularity and they are, or can be, major instruments of 
			propaganda. The anarchist must still deal with the inability of 
			people to see the possibility of a society without government, and 
			the presentation of such a society in a well-written novel could be 
			an effective way of presenting answers to the beliefs of the 
			opponents of anarchism. If such a novel is not forthcoming, it is 
			then important to look at the anarchist utopias of the past even 
			though in some ways they are outmoded and seem a bit naive.&quot;</p>

			<h3>D.P.</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext">&quot;Anarchism has not been very significant in 
			mainstream Science Fiction.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The more inwardly looking &quot;new Wave&quot; is, 
			perhaps, closer to our point of view. It depends on your attitude to 
			vague bohemianism, self-realisation is not necessarily the same as 
			self-indulgence.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: right">(&#39;The Dispossessed&#39;, 1976)</p>
			<h3>Vittorio Curtoni</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Genere letterario &quot;popolare&quot; nel senso 
			migliore del termine, ha in se i germi di una ribellione profonda, 
			di un modo <em>diverso</em> di considerare le cose del mondo: è, 
			insomma, rivoluzionaria nella sua sostanza.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Il che, purtroppo, non significa che abbia 
			prodotto solo e sempre cose rivoluzionarie, anzi. Sul suo sviluppo 
			ha influito pesantemente il fatto di essere cresciuta in America, 
			condizionata e viziata da una coscienza politica ben diversa da 
			quella europea; e poi molti degli autori che l&#39;hanno usata per 
			raccontare le loro storie ci vedevano soprattutto il trionfo della 
			scienza, lo sviluppo di un futuro armonico che avrebbe portato 
			l&#39;uomo a essere signore del cosmo. Sino al termine della seconda 
			guerra mondiale, grosso modo, predomina in science-fiction lo 
			spirito del capitalismo battagliero che abbandona la Terra e si 
			espande nell&#39;universo. Nasce una specie d&#39;imperialismo cosmico (naturalmente 
			benevolo, disinteressato e civilizzatore, almeno stando a quanto ci 
			dicono) che esporta i sommi valori umani sugli altri pianeti; e gli 
			alieni, gli extraterrestri, o sono mostri guerrafondai da 
			distruggere subito, o sono creature inferiori che di buon grado 
			accettano la nostra superiorità, o ancora si trasformano in alleati 
			per ulteriori lotte. Prevale la logica del contrabbando di idee 
			reazionarie: ma gli americani sono ancora lì con le loro frontiere 
			vergini, si credono i padroni del mondo, non vedono alternative.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Gli anni Sessanta sono dominati da quella che 
			si definisce &quot;new wave&quot;, cioè &quot;nuova ondata&quot;, corrente che ebbe il 
			suo centro focale in Inghilterra e che si preoccupò principalmente 
			di un rinnovamento<em> stilistico</em> della fantascienza. 
			Esperimenti verbali di ogni tipo videro la luce sulle colonne di 
			&quot;New Worlds&quot;, mentre l&#39;interesse per la dinamica sociale passò, in 
			genere, in secondo piano. Ma, per quanto sia vero che buona parte 
			dei lavori di quel periodo si possono vedere come pure e semplici 
			esibizioni di narcisismo letterario, sarebbe sbagliato trarre un 
			bilancio negativo a livello ideologico. Anzi: a me pare che proprio 
			la &quot;new wave&quot; abbia rappresentato l&#39;instaurazione di un modello 
			anarchico in science-fiction, solo che in genere l&#39;anarchia si 
			fermava alla forma e non raggiungeva i contenuti.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Il fatto centrale, credo, è che oggi sono in 
			attività molti giovani scrittori, gente che ha vissuto l&#39;esperienza 
			delle rivolte studentesche (non sempre in prima persona, ma insomma 
			di certe cose ha preso coscienza), che non crede più nelle 
			meraviglie riservate alla nostra razza dal futuro, che vuole mettere 
			in luce i lati negativi della società in cui siamo immersi. Il dato 
			basilare è che la science fiction si è trasformata in uno strumento 
			di critica, di lotta, di impegno sul terreno dei fatti concreti: 
			certo, si continua a viaggiare nel futuro, si vola sempre su altri 
			pianeti, ma in questo futuro e in questi pianeti si legge ormai, 
			nettissimo, il riflesso del presente, del qui-e-ora, della libertà 
			che non può essere soffocata all&#39;infinito.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Io credo, ne sono certo, che proprio il &#39;68 
			abbia rappresentato lo spartiacque per la fantascienza contemporanea. 
			Gli scrittori che oggi lavorano nel campo hanno assorbito, in buona 
			parte, i temi della cultura europea, compresa la necessità di 
			radicalizzare le scelte politiche, di non viaggiare più all&#39;insegna 
			di un umanitarismo generico.&quot;</p>

			<h3>Gabriele P.</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">L&#39;anarchia è un&#39;utopia &quot;reale&quot;. Proprio in 
			questo contrasto sta la sua vitalità. È pericolo voler cercare od 
			identificare una letteratura o una cultura anarchica, 
			fantascientifica o meno, perché sarebbe come dire che gli anarchici 
			e l&#39;anarchismo sono un elemento del sistema sociale, mentre non è 
			vero, il sistema sociale che gli anarchici progettano e perseguono 
			non esiste ancora. Diciamo che non c&#39;è riflesso nella fantascienza 
			dell&#39;anarchia a meno che non sia un riflesso espresso da un singolo 
			individuo come è del resto. La mia paura è che qualcuno creda che ci 
			sia riflesso della fantascienza nell&#39;anarchia.</p>

			<h3>Lessa, Takver and Alyx</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Science Fiction has a particular appeal for 
			those who are committed to radical social change. The construction 
			of a parallel world embodying the worst of our fears and the finest 
			of our hopes, delights, terrifies, stimulates and inspires us. 
			Fantasy worlds are powerful tools. As ideas crystallize in the 
			details of future societies, a psychological acceptance of certain 
			possibilities is created. Attention to the unfolding of the fantasy 
			worlds can be a practical political exercise for the readers as well 
			as for the writers.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;What it boils down to is that a vision for 
			the future is an intrinsic part of our political position—how can we 
			act to transform society without a conception of what we want to 
			create?&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Science fiction doesn&#39;t give us a complete 
			picture. There are some areas that leave us quite unsettled. Several 
			books describe a need for coercion in work distribution; none of the 
			authors successfully outlines a method for dealing with extreme 
			anti-social behaviour. The militarism in most of the books is 
			disturbing.</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;There isn&#39;t enough historical detail in 
			science fiction to connect us from here to there. But, when all is 
			read and done, it is our future we&#39;re working on. Imagination at the 
			very least reminds us of our goals.&quot;</p>

			<h3>Michael Moorcock</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Utopian fiction has been predominantly 
			reactionary in one form or another (as well as being predominantly 
			dull) since it began.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Writers, when they are writing, can only be 
			judged on the substance of their work. The majority of the sf 
			writers most popular with radicals are by and large crypto-fascists 
			to a man and woman! There is Lovecraft, the misogynistic racist; there 
			is Heinlein, the authoritarian militarist; there is Ayn Rand, the 
			rabid opponent of trade unionism and the left, who, like many a 
			reactionary before her, sees the problems of the world as a failure 
			by capitalists to assume the responsibilities of &#39;good leadership&#39;; 
			there is Tolkein and that group of middle-class Christian fantasists 
			who constantly sing the praises of bourgeois virtues and whose 
			villains are thinly disguised working class agitators -- fear of the 
			Mob permeates their rural romances. To all these and more the 
			working class is a mindless beast which must be controlled or it 
			will savage the world (i.e. bourgeois security) -- the answer is 
			always leadership, &#39;decency&#39;, paternalism (Heinlein in particularly 
			strong on this), Christian values...</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;What can this stuff have in common with 
			radicals of any persuasion? The simple answer is, perhaps, Romance. 
			The dividing line between rightist Romance (Nazi insignia and myth 
			etc.) and leftist Romance (insurgent cavalry etc.) is not always 
			easy to determine. A stirring image is a stirring image and can be 
			,employed to raise all sorts of atavistic or infantile emotions in 
			us. Escapist or &#39;genre&#39; fiction appeals to these emotions. It does 
			us no harm to escape from time to time but it can be dangerous to 
			confuse simplified fiction with reality and that, of course, is what 
			propaganda does.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Traditional sf is hero fiction on a huge 
			scale, but it is only when it poses as a fiction of ideas that it 
			becomes completely pernicious. At its most spectacular it gives us 
			Charlie Manson and Scientology (invented by the sf writer Ron 
			Hubbard and an authoritarian system to rival the Pope&#39;s). To enjoy 
			it is one thing. To claim it as &#39;radical&#39; is quite another. It is 
			rather unimaginative; it is usually badly written; its characters 
			are ciphers; its propaganda is simple-minded and conservative -- 
			good old-fashioned opium which might be specifically designed for 
			dealing with the potential revolutionary.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;By and large the world we got in the thirties 
			was the world the sf writers of the day hoped we would have -- 
			&#39;strong leaders&#39; reshaping nations.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;So little sf has fundamental humanitarian 
			values, let alone libertarian ideals, one is hard put to find other 
			examples.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Next time you pick up a Heinlein book think 
			of the author as looking a bit like General Eisenhower or, if that 
			image isn&#39;t immediate enough, some chap in early middle age, 
			good-looking in a slightly soft way, with silver at the temples, a 
			blue tie, a sober three-pieced suit, telling you with a quiet smile 
			that Margaret Thatcher cares for individualism and opportunity above 
			all things, as passionately in her way as you do in yours. And then 
			you might have some idea of what you&#39;re actually about to read.&quot; </p>

			<h3>Robert 
			Shea</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;Naturally, 
			anarchists would like to see more anarchist science fiction: 
			everybody would like to see their favourite kind of fiction reflect 
			their favorite political ideas. There are many kinds of anarchism; 
			at least one novel could be written about each sort. Anarchist ideas 
			raise a great many problems to which a variety of solutions can be 
			offered, all of which could be examined in a speculative way in 
			fiction. Nearly every anarchist I know is also a science fiction 
			fan, and science fiction fans always want to write the stuff 
			themselves, so there should be enough writers to care of all the 
			available science fiction ideas.&quot;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">. . . &quot;anarchist 
			science fiction can be a most effective device for bringing the 
			vision of freedom to concrete life. Those fans, critics, editors and 
			writers to whom the ideal of freedom is congenial can, by each 
			working a little harder at his or her own thing, make more room in 
			science fiction for anarchist ideas.&quot;</p>

			<h3>Leona</h3>
			<p class="aplaintext" style="text-align: justify">&quot;The problem with 
			utopias is that they are plans. Most anarchists understand that 
			plans for situations we haven&#39;t been in are too limited and/or short 
			sighted to be helpful. But the good thing about plans is that 
			committing to them <i>in our imagination</i> encourages us to flesh 
			out what we really want, what we think is possible: this imagining 
			can be a challenge for our daily lives. Science fiction gives us 
			leeway to be as imaginative as possible, utopias encourage us to 
			commit to how we really want to live.&quot;</p>

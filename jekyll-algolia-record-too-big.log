In Time Out of Joint the central character believes he is living in the  1950s, as a competition expert; in reality he is living in the 1990s, helping  plan the bombing of the moon; his fantasy is a withdrawal psychosis, the only  way he can continue this work, having been converted to the 'lunatic' cause.\n \nThe society of Galactic Pot-Healer has  been described as \"the ultimate Communist denial of personal consciousness.\" (<a href=\"http://mises.org/daily/5089\">Riggenbach</a>)\n \nThe Man in the High Castle, Ubik, and Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, among Dick's best, are listed in  Curtoni's essential bibliography, but not discussed by him.

A reclusive computer geek is commissioned by 'The Management' to work on a formula which would prove that life has no meaning. Very much in the vein of Brazil. Eccentric, humorous, but darkly bleak.
 
Listed by Glenn, in the BASTARD chronicles, as a subversive film dealing with individual alienation.

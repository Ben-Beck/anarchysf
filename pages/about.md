## Why Anarchism?

Naturally, this site has anarchism at its core. For some of the contributors and maintainers of the site it may be a political perspective or a way of life. However, not all who maintain or contribute to the site have to be anarchists; in general, anarchists tend to come in many colors and we do not wish to "divide the left", as the clich√© goes. Instead, this archive views anarchy as an object to be discovered, an ideology to be studied, and aims to be a repository of knowledge for all who are interested in anarchy, regardless of political affiliation.

## Why Science Fiction?

As Ben's intro above hints at, science fiction has had a long and fruitful romance with anarchy. This relationship started in the very first days of the genre but has exploded in popularity ever since the 70's, where it enjoyed its first renaissance. Thus, the topic of science fiction and anarchism is already one on which much discourse exists and gathering that discourse seems like a fruitful and productive exercise (this site includes both [a page which collects quotes from anarchists on science fiction](todo.com) and [an extensive bibliography for more reading on the subject](todo.com)). In addition, the maintainers of the site simply have a passion for both science fiction and leftist ideology, wherein their interest in maintaining and updating this site was formed.

However, it is definitely true that science fiction "objectively" lends itself well to the expression of anarchy. This propensity might stem from the fact that anarchy is inherently a revolt against the current order of things and is thus focused on the future. Science fiction also looks to the future, beyond our current society, offering a kind of "tabula rasa" onto which can be imagined a future where anarchism is form (or, to be accurate, set of forms) along which society is organized.

ForAnders Monsen, Emphyrio depicts "how casual acts of rebellion have grave repercussions that can lead to more radical acts of rebellion."Wally Conger sums this old-school space opera as "one hell of a good freedom novel".
Â 
Dan Clore lists Wyst as "An 'egalist' dystopia." The society portrayed values leisure above all, and is energetically egalitarian. Though interesting and entertaining, there isn't really much for anarchists here.

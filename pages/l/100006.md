For Moorcock, writing in 1978,  "Fritz Leiber is probably the best of all the American sf writers for his prose-style,  his wit and his humanity, as well as his abiding contempt for authoritarianism,  and Gather, Darkness is one of the best sf books to relate political  power to religious power" . . . .
   The book concerns an underground witch  conspiracy against establishment theocracy, all founded on scientific gadgetry.  Though commendably irreligious, it is lightweight.

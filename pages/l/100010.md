A classic and very readable dystopia, in which the protagonist rebels against a future totalitarian world. Somewhat reminiscent of The Prisoner. Winner of the Libertarian Futurist Society Hall of Fame Award in 1992. JeffRiggenbach regards it as "one of the top half-dozen libertarian novels ever published in our language."

SF for children, but now reads as rather dated, and over-religious.
 
Warmly remembered by a contributor to the Facebook Anarchism and Science Fiction Forum, who quotes aweb article on the book as saying ""There’s a political, anti-conformist message, and at its heart is the importance of family, community, freedom of choice, and, most of all, love."

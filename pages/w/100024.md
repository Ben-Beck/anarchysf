Les Guerillères is a poetic evocation of a band of women fighters for liberation from sexist oppression. It is quoted prominently, but without comment, in Open Road's 1978 article. In its emphasis on the necessary purgative power of destruction as a prerequisite for creation it is close to Bakunin's formula equating the two.

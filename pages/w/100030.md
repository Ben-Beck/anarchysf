The disappearance is of males and females from each other's worlds, a sudden and inexplicable event which allows Wylie to examine conditioned sex roles and stereotyping with some degree of perception. For Pilgrim this brilliant book was "one of the most convincing diagnoses of the ills of human society with which I have met." (368).

Both are included in Teflon's list ofAnarchist Science Fiction: Essential Novels, where Revelation Space is described as "Antiauthoritarian but not specifically anarchist"; Chasm City is set in the same universe. Revelation Space is also suggested bypharm on MetaFilter. Both are also recommended by Clark onPopehat; both are over-long space operas.

Utopian fantasy, meriting inclusion by virtue of Read's importance in the history of anarchism in Britain. GeorgeWoodcock found this novel to be "a parable illuminating the dialectic that runs through all of Read's works: thenecessary interplay between freedom and order, between reason and instinct, on which the organic reality of life as wellas of art depends." (Woodcock 1972a:77)

Read invited Emma Goldman to tea in 1938, and became (with Ethel Mannin) one of the only two "real comrades and friends" that she made during her three years in London [Goodway: 129, 132]

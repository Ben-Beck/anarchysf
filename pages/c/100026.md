A teenage thug in a a dystopian near-future 			Britain is cured of his violent ways by aversion therapy, the moral 			being an inversion of the Frankenstein story, namely that it is as 			wrong to unmake a monster, by taking away his free will, as to make 			one. Aurally and visually intense, and challenging to watch.

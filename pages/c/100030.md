Comfort—renowned sexologist and gerontologist—was at one time better known as an anarchist. The novel concerns the discovery of a sexually-liberating drug, and the havoc it wreaks on an uptight society. It's not explicitly anarchist, though it tends that way.
 
Harold Drasdo, discussing Comfort's work in Anarchy in November 1963, wrote:
 
Humour is a notoriously erratic weapon but most readers  without insuperable sexual barriers ought to enjoy this book thoroughly. [ . . .  ] it presents serious and humane ideas about sexual and personal relationships  and about modern science and politics." (Drasdo: 352)

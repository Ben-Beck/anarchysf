Explores an attractive anarchist society in a post-collapse 22nd  century San Francisco. Anu Bonobo, in  Fifth Estate,  described it as "more an imaginary treasure map than  utopia-by-the-numbers blueprint . . .". Carlsson, in the acknowledgments,  depicts the novel simply: "a stab at describing the world I'd like to wake up  into."

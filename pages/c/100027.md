The life of an ordinary blue-collar work changes forever after an encounter with a UFO, leading eventually to first contact with the aliens.

Joe Schembrie's 'Science Fiction and Libertarianism' notes the film's anti-government aspect, in that "the aliens turn from government attempts to contact them and instead embrace a group of private citizens". TimCavanaugh, who in general would exclude all Spielberg and Lucas movies from consideration as libertarian, wrote in 2004 that "I'm tempted to give a pass toClose Encounters because it popularized black helicopter culture".

The whole of North  Africa has become a political isolate thanks to its controversial use of  anti-entropic free energy from nanotechnology. Money is increasingly pointless,  and guns won't function, as a consequence of "a local accumulation of  anti-entropy". A pre-utopian sidelong glimpse of the state in the very act of withering  away.

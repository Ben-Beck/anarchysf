Ten years hence a vampire corporation captures and farms the 			remaining mortal humans while developing a substitute for human 			blood. A vampire hematologist's work is interrupted by human 			survivors led by a former vampire who has discovered a cure for 			vampirism. The sf context is well developed, so it's not just 			another vampire movie.
Â 
Recommended for a fairly obvious political message, by a poster to 			the Reddit discussion on						movie recommendations containing Anarchy.			SFE 			says "the use of vampirism as an allegory of oil dependency stands 			out from the red tide of other vampire fiction in its era."

Dakan is described byKilljoy, in one of his featured interviews, as an 'anarchist geek'. This entertaining caper story was taken as 'certainly' science fiction by a contributor to the Anarchysf mailing list, but can't really be seen as sf at all, though it's still likely to be of interest to sf readers.

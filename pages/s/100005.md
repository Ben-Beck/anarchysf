Sargent's important thematic anthology was referred to by Curtoni as "the first women's (and feminist) anthology of sf" (Curtoni 1978: 26); but he obviously knew the work only by repute, since he attributed it to Joanna Russ. Sargent's long and interesting introduction was quoted from in Lessa, Takver & Alyx's 1978Open Road article (8).

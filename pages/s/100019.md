Described in <a href="http://obsolete-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/obso10finalwatermarksample.pdf"> <i>Obsolete</i> #10</a>, in 2017, as a "masterpiece, in which a parasite runs  rampant in a luxury high-rise apartment building, creating a population of  sex-crazed zombies." The reviewer rightly compares it with Ben Wheatley's 2015 High-Rise, which reflects its "bizarre excellence."

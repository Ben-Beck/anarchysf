Influential black and white 28 minute short almost entirely composed of photographic stills, telling an enigmatic tale of time travel.
 
Marker is quoted as saying "I practice, without ostentation, a tranquil anarchism which allows me to traverse this society’s booby-trapped byways without too many mishaps". [Traon]

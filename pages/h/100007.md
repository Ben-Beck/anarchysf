Made for TV, and based on the Vonnegut short story, but  considerably reworked. Good, but the 2009 version (entitled  2081), which reverted to the original, is  appreciably better.
 
<a href="biblio.htm#Osborne">Osborne</a> reviewed the film  enthusiastically (but before 2081 came out):  "For a cinematic attack on enforced equality, you could hardly do better than  this wonderful film. [. . .] This is a moving and stimulating experience, and  one of the most dead-on libertarian films ever made."

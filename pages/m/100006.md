Maine had a particular attraction for Freedom's reviewers of the late '50s and early '60s. Although probably not even among the second tier of sf writers, one can see why: a persistent anti-authoritarian streak runs through his work.  Pilgrim regarded The Tide Went Out as Maine's best book, epitomising  Maine's preoccupation with the "perfidy of governments".

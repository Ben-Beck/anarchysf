It's a bit of a stretch to regard this as science fiction, but I'm happy to count it as such on the strength of its inclusion in theRed Planets filmography, where it's described as a "Comedy about the absurdity of ultramodernity." It's a delightful light comedy, and beautifully observed, having a gentle dig at consumerism, and suggesting that there might be more important values than materialism.

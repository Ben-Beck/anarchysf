"Governments and corporations wage war against anarchist enclaves." (Dan Clore)
Â 
The dense text and opacity of the storyline tend to dilute such interest as the reader might have in the self-contained enclaves, which are more outlaw than anarchist, notwithstanding a passing nod in the direction of Kropotkin.

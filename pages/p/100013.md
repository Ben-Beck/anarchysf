Reviewed by Margaret Killjoy atThe Anarcho-Geek Review, who noted that "the filmmakers actually took the themes of the movie in interesting directions," one theme being class war, though as a whole the film is essentially "a liberal parable," indeed "terribly liberal." Killjoy points out, too, that the focus on violent killing is unrealistic, as during a temporary suspension of law enforcement people are much more likely to indulge in looting than in revenge murder.

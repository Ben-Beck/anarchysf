Idoru's Walled City "presents us with a new model of anarchist politics, for it insists that truly radical activities cannot becarried out within the epistemological framework of modern spatial relations" (Call: 105). For Seán Sheehan, however, "Cyberpunk is partly characterized by neat, throw-away concepts like the Walled City, but such ideas hardly constitute an attempt to dismantle the bourgeois forms of reality, especially when they occur within novels like Idoru that are utterly conventional in their narrative form."
 
A rather questionable link here, butJeff Riggenbach has traced a perceived influence on Pattern Recognition from the neoliberal economist Friedrich Hayek.

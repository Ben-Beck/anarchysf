A future of sexual apartheid, with men in the cities and women in the hills, seen exclusively from the women's point of view; the women have developed nebulous psi powers and communicate freely with animals and birds as well as each other.
 
Widely noted as among the feminist utopias of the second wave of the feminist movement (seePiercy, for example). Described by Mark Bould as a "Lesbian feminist utopia."

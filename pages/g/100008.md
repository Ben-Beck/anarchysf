Confused and derivative story of Esperanto-speaking anarchists waging war on society from a marvellous new airship.Their leader proclaims himself Emperor of the Air and rapidly forgets any anarchist principles he may ever have had,whereupon ground-based anarchists collaborate with police forces in opposing him. The novel concludes when theairship impales itself on the summit of Mt Everest. Exceptionally silly.

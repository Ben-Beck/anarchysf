Welcome to anarchySF, an open-source repository of anarchist or anarchy-adjacent science fiction. Featured on the site are books, movies, and other media which are either anarchist in their politics or of interest to anarchists.

This archive was first collected and organized by [Ben Beck](http://benbeck.co.uk), who gathered and maintained it for the better part of three decades (!). As of 2019, it was redesigned and re-built by Eden Kupermintz and Yanai Sened as a collaborative effort. Eventually, the goal is for a community to maintain the wealth of knowledge on this site, and add to it.

However, the basic mission of the archive has stayed the same. In Ben's own words: "<em>Science fiction is inescapably the most suitable genre for speculation about an anarchist or libertarian (left or right) future, and utopian fiction is itself sometimes seen as a sub-genre of science fiction. As such, science fiction has long been attractive to anarchist readers."</em>

Our goal with rebuilding the site is to use modern content management frameworks to allow a community to form around the archive and help maintain it. No one person could ever keep it fresh and accurate for long and, besides, that wouldn't be very anarchic of us would it? Instead, relying on the principles of mutual aid, we would like to invite others to help us maintain the archive.

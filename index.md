Welcome to anarchySF, an open-source repository of anarchist or anarchy-adjacent science fiction. Featured on the site are books, movies, and other media which are either anarchist in their politics or of interest to anarchists.

This archive was first collected and organized by [Ben Beck](http://benbeck.co.uk). In 2019, it was redesigned and re-built by Eden Kupermintz and Yanai Sened. However, the mission of the archive has stayed the same. In Ben's own words:

"Science fiction is inescapably the most suitable genre for speculation about an anarchist or libertarian (left or right) future, and utopian fiction is itself sometimes seen as a sub-genre of science fiction. As such, science fiction has long been attractive to anarchist readers.

There is, too, a natural tendency to view space, and space exploration, as a metaphor for the freedom so dear to anarchists. But this is not to say that science fiction is in itself quintessentially anarchist. This website seeks only to explore such science fiction as has been created by anarchists or anarchist sympathizers, has been subject to notice by anarchist critics, or indeed has been attacked by anarchist critics. Just an anarchist take on science fiction, if you like."
